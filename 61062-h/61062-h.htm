  <h2 class='c004'>EDITOR’S NOTE.</h2>
</div>
<hr class='c005' />
<p class='c006'>The only changes made in revising this work are in the local
allusions to England as “our country,” etc., and in a few
phrases and expressions naturally arising from the original preparation
of the chapters for successive numbers of a magazine.
If any reader thinks that the Author’s enthusiasm in his subject
has caused him to ascribe too great influence to the “Methodist
movement,” and not to give due recognition to other potent
agencies in the “great awakening” of the last century, let him
remember that this volume does not profess to give a <i>complete</i>,
but only a <i>partial</i> history of the Great Revival. Indeed, the
Author’s graphic pictures relate chiefly to the movement, as it
swept over London and the great mining centres of England,
where the truth, as proclaimed by the great leaders, Whitefield,
the Wesleys, and their co-laborers, won its greatest victories,
and where Methodism has ever continued to render some of its
most valiant and glorious services for Christ. It is not to be
inferred that in Scotland, Ireland, and in the American colonies,
as in many portions of England, other organizations, dissenting
societies and churches were not a power in spreading the Great
Revival movement.</p>

<p class='c007'>A brief chapter has been added at the close, sketching some
phases of the revival in the American colonies, under the labors
of Edwards, Whitefield, the Tennents, and their associates.
Whatever other material has been added by the Editor is indicated
by brackets, thus leaving the distinguished Author’s views
and expressions intact.</p>

<p class='c007'>An Index has also been added, to increase the permanent
value of the book to the reader. If the history of the remarkable
“religious awakenings” of the eighteenth century were
more diligently studied, and the holy enthusiasm and wonderful
zeal of those great leaders in “hunting for souls” were to
inspire workers of this century, what marvellous conquests and
victories should we witness for the Son of God!</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>PREFACE.</h2>
</div>
<hr class='c005' />
<p class='c006'>The author of the following pages begs that
they may be read kindly—and, he will venture
to say, <i>not</i> critically. Originally published as
a series of papers in the <i>Sunday at Home</i>, *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*
they are only <i>Vignettes</i>—etchings. The History
of the great Religious Movement of the Eighteenth
Century yet remains unwritten; not
often has the world known such a marvellous
awakening of religious thought; and, as we are
further removed in time, so, perhaps, we are
better able to judge of the momentous circumstances,
could we but seize the point of view.</p>

</div>
<p class='c006'>It cannot be too often remembered or repeated
that when the Bible has been brought
face to face with the conscience of corrupt
society, in every age it has shown itself to be
that which it professes, and which its believers
declare it to be—“the great power of God.” It
proved itself thus amidst the hoary and decaying
corruptions of the ancient civilisation, when
its truths were first published to the Roman
Empire; it proclaimed its power to the impure
but polished society of Florence, when Savonarola
preached his wonderful sermons in St.
Mark’s; and effected the same results throughout
the whole German Empire, when Bible
truth sounded forth from Luther’s trumpet-tones.
The same principle is illustrated where
the great evangelical truths of the New Testament
entered nations, as in Spain or France,
only to be rejected. From that rejection and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>the martyrdoms of the first believers; those
nations have never recovered themselves even
to this hour; and of the two nations, that in
which the rejection was the most haughty and
cruel, has suffered most from its renunciation.</p>

<p class='c007'>England has passed through three great
evangelical revivals.</p>

<p class='c007'>The first, the period of the <span class='sc'>Reformation</span>,
whose force was latent there, even before the
waves of the great German revolution reached
its shores, and called forth the pen of a monarch,
and that monarch a haughty Tudor, to enter
the lists of disputation with the lowly-born son
of a miner of Hartz Mountains. What that
Reformation effected in England we all very
well know; the changes it wrought in opinion,
the martyrs who passed away in their chariots
of fire in vindication of its doctrines, the great
writers and preachers to whose works and
names we frequently and lovingly refer.</p>

<p class='c007'>Then came the second great evangelical
revival, the period of <span class='sc'>Puritanism</span>,<a id='r1' /><a href='#f1' class='c012'><b>[1]</b></a> whose
central interests gather round the great civil
wars. This was the time, and these were the
opinions which produced some of the most
massive and magnificent writers of our language;
the whole mind of the country was
stirred to its deepest heart by faith in those
truths, which to believe enobles human nature,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>and enables it to endure “as seeing Him who
is invisible.” There can be no doubt that it
produced some of the grandest and noblest
minds, whether for service by sword or pen, in
the pulpit or the cabinet, that the world has
known. Lord Macaulay’s magnificently glowing
description of the English Puritan, and how
he attained, by his evangelical opinions, his
stature of strength, will be familiar to all readers
who know his essay on Milton.</p>

<div class='footnote c013' id='f1'>
<p class='c014'><span class='label'><a href='#r1'>1</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Appendix <a href='#app-a'>A</a>.</p>
</div>

<p class='c007'>But the present aim is to gather up some of
the facts and impressions, and briefly to recite
some of the influences of the third great evangelical
revival in the Eighteenth Century. We
are guilty of no exaggeration in saying that
these have been equally deserving historic
fame with either of the preceding. The story
has less, perhaps, to excite some of our most
passionate human interests; it had not to make
its way through stakes and scaffolds, although
it could recite many tales of persecution; it
unsheathed no sword, the weapons of its warfare
were not carnal; and on the whole, it
may be said its doctrine distilled “as the dew;”
yet it is not too much to say that from the revival
of the last century came forth that wonderfully
manifold reticulation and holy machinery
of piety and benevolence, we find in such
active operation around us to-day.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>All impartial historians of the period place this
most remarkable religious impulse in the rank of
the very foremost phenomena of the times. The
calm and able historian, Earl Stanhope, speaking
of it, as “despised at its commencement,”
continues, “with less immediate importance
than wars or political changes, it endures long
after not only the result but the memory of
these has passed away, and thousands” (his
lordship ought to have said millions) “who
never heard of Fontenoy or Walpole, continue
to follow the precepts, and venerate the name
of John Wesley.” While the latest, a still more
able and equally impartial and quiet historian,
Mr. Lecky, says, “Our splendid victories by
land and sea must yield in real importance to
this religious revolution; it exercised a profound
and lasting influence upon the spirit of
the Established Church of England, upon the
amount and distribution of the moral forces of
that nation, and even upon the course of its
political history.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Shall we, then, first attempt to obtain some
adequate idea of what this Revival effected, by
a slight effort to realise what sort of world and
state of society it was into which the Revival
came? One writer truly remarks, “Never has
century risen on christian England so void of
soul and faith as that which opened with Queen
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>Anne, and which reached its misty noon beneath
the second George, a dewless night succeeded
by a dewless dawn. There was no
freshness in the past and no promise in the
future; the Puritans were buried, the Methodists
were not born.” It is unquestionably true
that black, bad and corrupt as society was, for
the most part, all round, in the eighteenth
century, intellectual and spiritual forces broke
forth, simultaneously we had almost said, and
believing, as we do, in the Providence which
governed the rise of both, we may say, consentaneously,
which have left far behind all social
regenerations which the pen of history has recited
before. Of almost all the fruits we enjoy,
it may be said the seeds were planted then;
even those which, like the printing-press or the
gospel, had been planted ages before, were so
transplanted as to flourish with a new vigour.</p>

<p class='c007'>Our eye has been taught to rest on an interesting
incident. It was in 1757 John Wesley,
travelling and preaching, then about fifty years
of age, but still with nearly forty years of work
before him, arrived in Glasgow. He saw in the
University its library and its pictures; but, had
he possessed the vision of a Hebrew seer he
might have glanced up from the quadrangle of
the college to the humble rooms, up a spiral
staircase, of a young workman, over whose
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>lodging was the sign and information that
they were tenanted by a “mathematical instrument
maker to the University.” This young
man, living there upon a poor fare, and eking
out a poor subsistence, with many thoughts
burdening his mind, was destined to be the
founder of the greatest commercial and material
revolution the world has known: through
him seems to have been fulfilled the wonderfully
significant prophecy of Nahum: “The
chariots shall rage in the streets, they shall
jostle one against another in the broad ways:
they shall seem like torches, they shall run
like the lightnings.” This young man was
James Watt, who gave to the world the steam
engine. A few years after he gave his mighty
invention to Birmingham; and the world has
never been the same world since. “By that
invention,” says Emerson, “one man can do the
work of two hundred and fifty men;” and in
Manchester alone and in its vicinity there are
probably sixty thousand boilers, and the aggregate
power of a million horses.</p>

<p class='c007'>Let not the allusion seem out of place. That
age was the seed-time of the present harvest
fields; in that time those great religious ideas
which have wrought such an astonishing revolution,
acquired body and form; and we ought
to notice how, when God sets free some new
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>idea, He also calls into existence the new vehicle
for its diffusion. He did not trust the early
christian faith to the old Latin races, to the
selfish and æsthetic Greek, or to the merely
conservative Hebrew; He “hissed,” in the
graphic language of the old Bible, for a new
race, and gave the New Testament to the
Teutonic people, who have ever been its chief
guardians and expositors; and thus, in all reviews
of the development and unfolding of the
religious life in the times of which we speak,
we have to notice how the material and the
spiritual changes have re-acted on each other,
while both have brought a change which has
indeed “made all things new.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Contrasting the state of society after the rise
of the Great Revival with what it was before,
the present with the past, it is quite obvious
that something has brought about a general
decency and decorum of manners, a tenderness
and benevolence of sentiment, a religious interest
in, and observance of, pious usages, not to
speak of a depth of religious life and conviction,
and a general purity and nobility of literary
taste, which did not exist before. All these
must be credited to this great movement. It is
not in the nature of steam engines, whether
stationary or locomotive, nor in printing
presses, or Staffordshire potteries, undirected
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>by spiritual forces, to raise the morals or to
improve the manners of mankind.</p>

<p class='c007'>If sometimes in the presence of the spectacles
of ignorance, crime, irreligion, and corruption
in our own day, we are filled with a sense of
despair for the prospects of society, it may be
well to take a retrospect of what society was in
England at the commencement of the last century.
When George III. ascended the throne
the population of England was not much over
five millions; at the commencement of the
present century it was nearly eleven millions;
but with the intensely crowded population of
the present day, the cancerous elements of society,
the dangerous, pauperised, and criminal
classes are in far less proportion, not merely
relatively, but really. It was a small country,
and possessed few inhabitants. There are few
circumstances which can give us much pleasure
in the review. National distress was constantly
making itself bitterly felt; it was the age of
mobs and riots. The state of the criminal law
was cruel in the extreme. Blackstone calculates
that for no fewer than one hundred and
sixty offences, some of them of the most frivolous
description, the judge was bound to pronounce
sentence of death. Crime, of course,
flourished. During the year 1738 no fewer
than fifty-two criminals were hanged at Tyburn.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>During that and the preceding years, twelve
thousand persons had been convicted, within
the Bills of Mortality, for smuggling gin and
selling it without licence. The amusements of
all classes of people were exactly of that order
calculated to create a cruel disposition, and
thus to encourage crime; bear-baiting, bull-baiting,
prize-fighting, cock-fighting: on a
Shrove Tuesday it was dangerous to pass down
any public street. This was the day selected
for the barbarity of tying a harmless cock to a
stake, there to be battered to death by throwing
a stick at it from a certain distance. The
grim humour of the people took this form of
expressing the national hatred to the French,
from the Latin name for the cock, <i>Gallus</i>. It
was in truth a barbarous pun.</p>

<p class='c007'>With abundant wealth and means of happiness,
the people fell far short of what we should
consider comfort now. Life and liberty were
cheap, and a prevalent Deism or Atheism was
united to a wild licentiousness of manners, brutalising
all classes of society. For the most
part, the Church of England had so shamefully
forgotten or neglected her duty—this is admitted
now by all her most ardent ministers—while
the Noncomformists had sunk generally
into so cold an indifferentism in devotion, and
so hard and sceptical a frame in theology, that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>every interest in the land was surrendered to
profligacy and recklessness, and, in thoughtful
minds, to despair. Society in general was
spiritually dead. The literature of England,
with two or three famous exceptions, suffered a
temporary eclipse. Such as it was, it was perverted
from all high purposes, and was utterly
alien to all purity and moral dignity. A good
idea of the moral tone of the times might be
obtained by running the eye over a few volumes
of the old plays of this period, many of
them even written by ladies; it is amazing to
us now to think not only that they could be
tolerated, but even applauded. The gaols were
filled with culprits; but this did not prevent the
heaths, moors, and forests from swarming with
highwaymen, and the cities with burglars. In
the remote regions of England, such as Cornwall
in the west, Yorkshire and Northumberland
in the north, and especially in the midland
Staffordshire, the manners were wild and savage,
passing all conception and description.
We have to conceive of a state of society divested
of all the educational, philanthropic, and
benevolent activities of modern times. There
were no Sunday-schools, and few day-schools;
here and there, some fortunate neighbourhood
possessed a grammar-school from some old
foundation. Or, perhaps some solitary chapel,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>retreating into a bye-lane in the metropolitan
city, or the country town, or, more probably,
far away from any town, stood at some confluence
of roads, a monument of old intolerance;
but, as we said, religious life was in fact dead,
or lying in a trance.</p>

<p class='c007'>As to the religious teachers of those times,
we know of no period in our history concerning
which it might so appropriately be said, in the
words of the prophet, “The pastors” are “become
brutish, and have not sought the Lord.”
In the life of a singular man, but not a good one,
Thomas Lord Lyttleton, in a letter dated 1775,
we have a most graphic portrait of a country
clergyman, a friend of Lyttleton, who went by
the designation of “Parson Adams.” We suppose
him to be no bad representative of the average
parson of that day—coarse, profane, jocular,
irreligious. On a Saturday evening he told
Lyttleton, his host, that he should send his
flocks to grass on the approaching Sabbath.
“The next morning,” says Lyttleton, “we
hinted to him that the company did not wish
to restrain him from attending the Divine service
of the parish; but he declared that it
would be adding contempt to neglect if, when
he had absented himself from his own church
he should go to any other. This curious etiquette
he strictly observed; and we passed a Sabbath
contrary, I fear, both to law and to gospel.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>If we desire to obtain some knowledge of
what the Church of England was, as represented
by her clergy when George III. was king,
we should go to her own records; and for the
later years of his reign, notably to the life of
that learned, active, and amiable man, Dr.
Blomfield, Bishop of London, whose memory
was a wonderful repository of anecdotes, not
tending to elevate the clergy of those times in
popular estimation. Intoxication was a vice
very characteristic of the cloth: on one occasion
the bishop reproved one of his Chester
clergy for drunkenness: he replied, “But, my
lord, I never was drunk on duty.” “On duty!”
exclaimed the bishop; “and pray, sir, when is
a clergyman not on duty?” “True,” said the
other; “my lord, I never thought of that.”
The bishop went into a poor man’s cottage in
one of the valleys in the Lake district, and
asked whether his clergyman ever visited him.
The poor man replied that he did very frequently.
The bishop was delighted, and expressed
his gratification at this pastoral oversight;
and this led to the discovery that
there were a good many foxes on the hills
behind the house, which gave the occasion for
the frequency of calls which could scarcely be
considered pastoral. The chaplain and son-in-law
of Bishop North examined candidates for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>orders in a tent on a cricket-field, he being
engaged as one of the players; the chaplain of
Bishop Douglas examined whilst shaving;
Bishop Watson never resided in his diocese
during an episcopate of thirty-four years.</p>

<p class='c007'>And those who preached seem rarely to have
been of a very edifying order of preachers;
Bishop Blomfield used to relate how, in his
boyhood, when at Bury St. Edmund’s, the Marquis
of Bristol had given a number of scarlet
cloaks to some poor old women; they all appeared
at church on the following Sunday, resplendent
in their new and bright array, and
the clergyman made the donation of the marquis
the subject of his discourse, announcing
his text with a graceful wave of his hand towards
the poor old bodies who were sitting there
all together: “Even Solomon, in all his glory,
was not arrayed like one of these!” This
worthy seems to have been very capable of
such things: on another occasion a dole of potatoes
was distributed by the local authorities
in Bury, and this also was improved in a sermon.
“He had himself,” the bishop says, “a
very corpulent frame, and pompous manner,
and a habit of rolling from side to side while he
delivered himself of his breathing thoughts and
burning words; on the occasion of the potato
dole, he chose for his singularly appropriate
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>text (Exodus xvi. 15): ‘And when the children
of Israel saw it, they said one to another,
It is manna;’ and thence he proceeded to
discourse to the recipients of the potatoes on
the warning furnished by the Israelites against
the sin of gluttony, and the wickedness of taking
more than their share.”</p>

<p class='c007'>When that admirable man, Mr. Shirley, began
his evangelistic ministry as the friend and
coadjutor of his cousin, the Countess of Huntingdon,
a curate went to the archbishop to
complain of his unclerical proceedings: “Oh,
your grace, I have something of great importance
to communicate; it will astonish you!”
“Indeed, what can it be?” said the archbishop.
“Why, my lord,” replied he, throwing into his
countenance an expression of horror, and expecting
the archbishop to be petrified with astonishment,
“he actually wears white stockings!”
“Very unclerical indeed,” said the archbishop,
apparently much surprised; he drew
his chair near to the curate, and with peculiar
earnestness, and in a sort of confidential whisper,
said, “Now tell me—I ask this with peculiar
feelings of interest—does Mr. Shirley wear
them over his boots?” “Why, no, your grace,
I cannot say he does.” “Well, sir, the first
time you ever hear of Mr. Shirley wearing them
over his boots, be so good as to warn me, and
I shall know how to deal with him!”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>We would not, on the other hand, be unjust.
We may well believe that there were hamlets
and villages where country clergymen realised
their duties and fulfilled them, and not only deserved
all the merit of Goldsmith’s charming
picture,<a id='r2' /><a href='#f2' class='c012'><b>[2]</b></a> but were faithful ministers of the New
Testament too. But our words and illustrations
refer to the average character presented
to us by the Church; and this, again, is illustrated
by the vehement hostility presented on
all hands to the first indications of the Great
Revival. For instance, the Rev. Dr. Thomas
Church, Vicar of Battersea, in a well-known
sermon on charity schools, deplored and denounced
the enormous wickedness of the times;
after saying, “Our streets are grievously infested;
every day we see the most dreadful
confusions, daring villanies, dangers, and mischiefs,
arising from the want of sentiments of
piety,” he continues: “For our own sakes and
our posterity’s everything should be encouraged
which will contribute to suppressing these evils,
and keep the poor from stealing, lying, drunkenness,
cruelty, or taking God’s name in vain.
While we feel our disease, ’tis madness to set
aside any remedy which has power to check its
fury.” Having said this, with a perfectly startling
inconsistency he turns round, and addressing
himself to Wesley and the Methodists, he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>says, “We cannot but regard you as our most
dangerous enemies.”</p>

<div class='footnote c013' id='f2'>
<p class='c014'><span class='label'><a href='#r2'>2</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Appendix <a href='#app-b'>B</a>.</p>
</div>

<p class='c007'>When the Great Revival arose, the Church of
England set herself, everywhere, in full array
against it; she possessed but few great minds.
The massive intellects of Butler and Berkeley
belonged to the immediately preceding age.
The most active intellect on the bench of bishops
was, no doubt, that of Warburton; and it
is sad to think that he descended to a tone of
scurrility and injustice in his attack on Wesley,
which, if worthy of his really quarrelsome temper,
was altogether unworthy of his position
and his powers.</p>

<p class='c007'>Thus, whether we derive our impressions
from the so-called Church of that time, or from
society at large, we obtain the evidences of a
deplorable recklessness of all ordinary principles
of religion, honour, or decorum. Bishop
Butler had written, in the “Advertisement” to
his <i>Analogy</i>, and he appears to have been referring
to the clerical and educated opinion of
his time: “It is come, I know not how, to be
taken for granted, by many persons, that Christianity
is not so much as a subject of inquiry;
but that it is, now at length, discovered to be
fictitious;” and he wrote his great work for the
purpose of arguing the reasonableness of the
christian religion, even on the principles of the
Deism prevalent everywhere around him in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>Church and society. Addison had declared
that there was “less appearance of religion in
England than in any neighbouring state or
kingdom, whether Protestant or Catholic;” and
Montesquieu came to the country, and having
made his notes, published, probably with some
French exaggeration, that there was “no religion
in England, and that the subject, if mentioned
in society, excited nothing but laughter.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Such was the state of England, when, as we
must think, by the special providence of God,
the voices were heard crying in the wilderness.
From the earlier years of the last century they
continued sounding with such clearness and
strength, from the centre to the remotest
corners of the kingdom; from, the coasts,
where the Cornish wrecker pursued his strange
craft of crime, along all the highways and
hedges, where rudeness and violence of every
description made their occasions for theft, outrage,
and cruelty, until the whole English nation
became, as if instinctively, alive with a
new-born soul, and not in vision, but in reality,
something was beheld like that seen by the
prophet in the valley of vision—dry bones
clothed with flesh, and standing up “an exceeding
great army,” no longer on the side of
corruption and death, but ready with song and
speech, and consistent living, to take their
place on the side of the Lord.</p>

</div>
<p class='c006'>In the history of the circumstances which
brought about the Great Revival, we must not
fail to notice those which were in action even before
the great apostles of the Revival appeared.
We have already given what may almost be
called a silhouette of society, an outline, for
the most part, all dark; and yet in the same
period there were relieving tints, just as sometimes,
upon a silhouette-portrait, you have seen
an attempt to throw in some resemblance to
the features by a touch of gold.</p>

<p class='c007'>Chief among these is one we do not remember
ever to have seen noticed in this connection—the
curious invasion of our country by the
French at the close of the seventeenth century.
That cruel exodus which poured itself upon
our shores in the great and even horrible persecution
of the Protestants of France, when the
blind bigotry of Louis XIV. revoked the Edict
of Nantes, was to us, as a nation, a really incalculable
blessing. It is quite singular, in reading
Dr. Smiles’s <i>Huguenots</i>, to notice the large
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>variety of names of illustrious exiles, eminent for
learning, science, character, and rank, who found
a refuge here. The folly of the King of France
expelled the chief captains of industry; they
came hither and established their manufactures
in different departments, creating and carrying
on new modes of industry. Also great numbers
of Protestant clergymen settled here, and
formed respectable French churches; some of
the most eminent ministers of our various denominations
at this moment are descendants
of those men. Their descendants are in our
peerage; they are on our bench of bishops;
they are at the bar; they stand high in the
ranks of commerce. At the commencement
of the eighteenth century, their ancestors were
settled on English shores; in all instances
men who had fled from comfort and domestic
peace, in many instances from affluence and
fame, rather than be false to their conscience
or to their Saviour. The cruelties of that dreadful
persecution which banished from France
almost every human element it was desirable
to retain in it, while they were, no doubt, there
the great ultimate cause of the French Revolution,
brought to England what must have been
even as the very seasoning of society, the salt
of our earth in the subsequent age of corruption.
Most of the children of these men
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>were brought up in the discipline of religious
households, such as that which Sir Samuel
Romilly—himself one of the descendants of an
earlier band of refugees. Dr. Watts’s mother
was a child of a French exile. Clusters of
them grew up in many neighbourhoods in the
country, notably in Southampton, Norwich,
Canterbury, in many parts of London, where
Spitalfields especially was a French colony.
When the Revival commenced, these were
ready to aid its various movements by their
character and influence. Some fell into the
Wesleyan ranks, though, probably, most, like
the eminent scholar and preacher, William
Romaine, one of the sons of the exile, maintained
the more Calvinistic faith, reflecting
most nearly the old creed of the Huguenot.</p>

<p class='c007'>This surmise of the influence of that noble
invasion upon the national well-being of Britain
is justified by inference from the facts. It
is very interesting to attempt to realise the
religious life of eminent activity and usefulness
sustained in different parts of the country before
the Revival dawned, and which must have
had an influence in fostering it when it arose.
And, indeed, while we would desire to give all
grateful honour to the extraordinary men (especially
to such a man as John Wesley, who
achieved so much through a life in which the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>length and the usefulness were equal to each
other, since only when he died did he cease to
animate by his personal influence the immense
organisation he had formed), yet it seems really
impossible to regard any one mind as the seed
and source of the great movement. It was as
if some cyclone of spiritual power swept all
round the nation—or, as if a subtle, unseen train
had been laid by many men, simultaneously, in
many counties, and the spark was struck, and
the whole was suddenly wrapped in a Divine
flame.</p>

<p class='c007'>Dr. Abel Stevens, in his most interesting,
indeed, charming history of Methodism, from
his point of view, gives to his own beloved
leader and Church the credit of the entire
movement; so also does Mr. Tyerman, in his
elaborate life of Wesley. But this is quite
contrary to all dispassionate dealing with
facts; there were many men and many means
in quiet operation, some of these even before
Wesley was born, of which his prehensile mind
availed itself to draw them into his gigantic
work; and there were many which had operated,
and continued to operate, which would not
fit themselves into his exact, and somewhat
exacting, groove of Church life.</p>

<p class='c007'>We have said it was as if a cyclone of spiritual
power were steadily sweeping round the minds
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>of men and nations, for there were undoubted
gusts of remarkable spiritual life in both hemispheres,
at least fifty years before Methodism
had distinctly asserted itself as a fact. Most
remarkable was the “Great Awakening” in
America, in Massachusetts—especially at
Northampton (that is a remarkable story, which
will always be associated with the name of
Jonathan Edwards).<a id='r3' /><a href='#f3' class='c012'><b>[3]</b></a> We have referred to the
exodus of the persecuted from France; equally
remarkable was another exodus of persecuted
Protestants from Salzburg, in Austria. The
madness of the Church of Rome again cast
forth an immense host of the holiest and most
industrious citizens. At the call of conscience
they marched forth in a body, taking joyfully
the spoiling of their goods rather than disavow
their faith: such men with their families are a
treasure to any nation amongst whom they may
settle. Thomas Carlyle has paid a glowing
historical eulogy to the memory of these men,
and the exodus has furnished Goethe with the
subject of one of his most charming poems.</p>

</div>

<p class='c007'>Philip Doddridge’s work was almost done before
the Methodist movement was known. It
seems to us that no adequate honour has ever yet
been paid to that most beautiful and remarkably
inclusive life. It was public, it was known
and noticed, but it was passed almost in retreat
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>in Northampton. That he was a preacher and
pastor of a Church was but a slight portion of
the life which succumbed, yet in the prime of
his days, to consumption. His academy for
the education of young ministers seems to us,
even now, something like a model of what such
an academy should be; his lectures to his students
are remarkably full and scholarly and
complete. From thence went forth men like
the saintly Risdon Darracott, the scholarly and
suggestive Hugh Farmer, Benjamin Fawcett,
and Andrew Kippis. The hymns of Doddridge
were among the earliest, as they are still
among the sweetest, of that kind of offering to
our modern Church; their clear, elevated,
thrush-like sweetness, like the more uplifted
seraphic trumpet tones of Watts, broke in upon
a time when there was no sacred song worthy
of the name in the Church, and anticipated the
hour when the melodious acclamations of the
people should be one of the most cherished elements
of Christian service.</p>

<p><span class='small'>ISAAC WATTS.</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>And Isaac Watts was, by far, the senior of
Doddridge; he lived very much the life of a
hermit. Although the pastor of a city church,
he was sequestered and withdrawn from public
life in Theobalds, or Stoke Newington, where,
however, he prosecuted a course of sacred labor
of a marvellously manifold description, inter-meddling
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>with every kind of learning, and consecrating
it all to the great end of the christian
ministry and the producing of books, which,
whether as catechisms for children, treatises for
the formation of mental character, philosophic
essays grappling with the difficulties of scholarly
minds, or “comfortable words” to “rock
the cradle of declining age,” were all to become
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>of value when the nation should awake to a real
spiritual power. They are mostly laid aside
now; but they have served more than one
generation well; and he, beyond question, was
the first who taught the Protestant Christian
Church in England to sing. His hymns and
psalms were sounding on when John Wesley
was yet a child, and numbers of them were appropriated
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>in the first Methodist hymn-book.
But Watts and Doddridge, by the conditions
of their physical and mental being, were unfitted
for popular leaders. Perhaps, also, it must
be admitted that they had not that which has
been called the “instinct for souls;” they were
concerned rather to illustrate and expound the
truth of God, and to “adorn the doctrine of
God our Saviour,” by their lives, than to flash
new convictions into the hearts of men. It is
characteristic that, good and great as they
were, they were both at first inimical to the
Great Revival; it seemed to them a suspicious
movement. The aged Watts cautioned his
younger friend Doddridge against encouraging
it, especially the preaching of Whitefield; yet
they both lived to give their whole hearts to it;
and some of Watts’s last words were in blessing,
when, near death, he received a visit from the
great evangelist.</p>

<p class='c007'>Thus we need to notice a little carefully the
age immediately preceding the rise of what we
call Methodism, in order to understand what
Methodism really effected; we have seen that
the dreadful condition of society was not inconsistent
with the existence over the country of
eminently holy men, and of even hallowed
christian families and circles. If space allowed,
it would be very pleasant to step into, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>sketch the life of many an interior; and it would
scarcely be a work of fancy, but of authentic
knowledge. There were yet many which almost
retained the character of Puritan households,
and among them several baronial halls.
Nor ought we to forget that those consistent:
and high-minded Christian folk, the Quakers
[Friends], were a much larger body then than
now, although, like the Shunammite lady, they
especially dwelt among their own people. The
Moravians also were in England; but all existed
like little scattered hamlet patches of spiritual
life; they were respectably conservative of their
own usages. Methodism brought enthusiasm
to religion, and the instinct for souls, united to
a power of organisation hitherto unknown to
the religious life.</p>

<p class='c007'>At what hour shall we fix the earliest dawn
of the Great Revival? Among the earliest
tints of the “morning spread upon the mountains,”
which was to descend into the valley, and
illuminate all the plains, was the conversion of
that extraordinary woman, Selina Shirley, the
Countess of Huntingdon; it is scarcely too
much to call her the Mother of the Revival; it
is not too much to apply to her the language of
the great Hebrew song—“The inhabitants of
the villages ceased, they ceased until that I
arose: I arose a mother in Israel.” She illustrates
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>the difference of which we spoke just
now, for there can be no doubt that she had a
passionate instinct for souls, to do good to
souls, to save souls. Her injunctions for the
destruction of all her private papers have been
so far complied with as to leave the earlier history
of her mind, and the circumstances which
brought about her conversion, for the most part
unknown. It is certain that she was on terms
of intimate friendship with both Watts and
Doddridge, but especially with Doddridge.
Another intimate friend of the Countess was
Watts’s very close friend, the Duchess of Somerset;
and thus the links of the story seem to
run, like that old and well-known instance of
communicated influence, when Andrew found
his own brother, Simon, and these in turn found
Philip and Nathaniel. It was very natural that,
beholding the state of society about her, she
should be interested, first, as it seems, for those
of her own order; it was at a later time, when
she became acquainted with Whitefield, that he
justified her drawing-room assemblies, by reminding
her—not, perhaps, with exact critical
propriety—of the text in Galatians, where Paul
mentioned how he preached “privately to those
of reputation.”<a id='r4' /><a href='#f4' class='c012'><b>[4]</b></a> For some time this appears to
have been the aim of the good Countess, much in
accordance with that pretty saying of hers, that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>“there was a text in which she blessed God for
the insertion of the letter M: ‘not <i>m</i>any noble.’”
The beautiful Countess was a heroine in her
own line from the earliest days of her conversion.
Belonging to one of the noblest families
of England, she had an entrance to the highest
circles, and her heart felt very pitiful for, especially,
the women of fashion around her, brokenhearted
with disappointment, or sick with <i>ennui</i>.</p>

<div class='footnote c013' id='f4'>
<p class='c014'><span class='label'><a href='#r4'>4</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Appendix <a href='#app-d'>D</a>.</p>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Among these was Sarah, the great Duchess
of Marlborough, apparently one of the intimate
friends of the Countess; her letters are most
characteristic. She mentions that the Duchess
of Ancaster, Lady Townshend, and others,
had just heard Mr. Whitefield preach, and
“What they said of the sermon has made me
lament ever since that I did not hear it; it
might have been the means of doing me some
good, for good, alas! I do want; but where
among the corrupt sons and daughters of Adam
am I to find it?” She goes on: “Dear, good
Lady Huntingdon, I have no comfort in my
own family; I hope you will shortly come and
see me; I always feel more happy and more
contented after an hour’s conversation with
you; when alone, my reflections and recollection
almost kill me. Now there is Lady Frances
Saunderson’s great rout to-morrow night;
all the world will be there, and I must go. I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>hate that woman as much as I hate a physician,
but I must go, if for no other purpose than to
mortify and spite her. This is very wicked, I
know, but I confess all my little peccadilloes to
you, for I know your goodness will lead you to
be mild and forgiving; and perhaps my wicked
heart may gain some good from you in the end.”
And then she closes her note with some remarks
on “that crooked, perverse little wretch
at Twickenham,” by which pleasant designation
she means the poet, Pope.</p>

<p class='c007'>Another, and another order of character, was
the Duchess of Buckingham; she came to hear
Whitefield preach in the drawing-room, and
was quite scandalised. In a letter to the
Countess, she says, “The doctrines are most
repulsive, and strongly tinctured with impertinence:
it is monstrous to be told that you have
a heart as sinful as the common wretches that
crawl the earth; this is highly offensive and
insulting, and I cannot but wonder that your
ladyship should relish any sentiments so much
at variance with high rank and good breeding.”
Such were some of the materials the Countess
attempted to gather in her drawing-rooms, if
possible to cure the aching of empty hearts. If
the two duchesses met together, it is very likely
they would be antipathetic to each other; a
prouder old lady than Sarah, the English empire
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>did not contain, but she was proud that
she was the wife and widow of the great Marlborough.
The Duchess of Buckingham was
equally proud that she was the natural daughter
of James II. When her son, the Duke of
Buckingham, died, she sent to the old Duchess
of Marlborough to borrow the magnificent car
which had borne John Churchill’s body to the
Abbey, and the fiery old Duchess sent her back
word, “It had carried Lord Marlborough, and
should never be profaned by any other corpse.”
The message was not likely to act as an <i>entente
cordiale</i> in such society as we have described.</p>

<p class='c007'>The mention of these names will show the
reader that we are speaking of a time when the
Revival had not wrought itself into a great
movement. The Countess continued to make
enthusiastic efforts for those of her own order—we
are afraid, with a few distinguished exceptions,
without any great amount of success;
but certainly, were it possible for us to look
into the drawing-room in South Audley Street,
in those closing years of the reign of George II.,
we might well be astonished at the brilliancy
of the concourse, and the finding ourselves
in the company of some of the most distinguished
names of the highest rank and fashion
of the period. It was the age of that cold, sardonic
sneerer, Horace Walpole; he writes to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>Florence, to his friend Sir Horace Mann, in his
scoffing fashion: “If you ever think of returning
to England, you must prepare yourself with
Methodism; this sect increases as fast as almost
any religious nonsense ever did; Lady Fanny
Shirley has chosen this way of bestowing the
dregs of her beauty, and Lyttleton is very near
making the same sacrifice of the dregs of all
those various characters that he has worn. The
Methodists love your big sinners as proper subjects
to work upon, and indeed they have a
plentiful harvest.” Then he satirises Lady
Ferrars, whom he styles “General, my Lady
Dowager Ferrars.” But, indeed, it is impossible
to enumerate the names of all, or any proportion
of the number who attended this brilliant
circle. Sometimes unhappy events took place;
Mr. Whitefield was sometimes too dreadfully,
although unconsciously, faithful. Lady Rockingham,
who really seems to have been inclined
to do good, begged the Countess to permit
her to bring the Countess of Suffolk, well
known as the powerful mistress of George II.
Whitefield “knew nothing of the matter;” but
some arrow “drawn at a venture,” and which
probably might have as well fitted many
another lady about the court or in that very
room, exactly hit the Countess. However
much she fidgeted with irritation, she sat out
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>the service in silence; but, as soon as it was
over, the beautiful fury burst forth in all the
stormful speech of a termagant or virago. She
abused Lady Huntingdon; she declared that
the whole service had been a premeditated
attack upon herself. Her relatives, Lady Bertie,
the celebrated Lady Betty Germain, the
Duchess of Ancaster, one of the most beautiful
women in England, and who, afterwards, with
the Duchess of Hamilton, conducted the future
queen of George III. to England’s shores, expostulated
with her, commanded her to be
silent, and attempted to explain her mistake;
they insisted that she should apologise to Lady
Huntingdon for her behaviour, and, in an ungracious
manner, she did so; but we learn that
she never honoured the assembly again with
her presence.</p>

<p class='c007'>What a singular assembly from time to time!
the square dark face of that old gentleman,
painfully hobbling in on his crutched stick—face
once as handsome as that of St. John, now
the disappointed, moody features of the massive,
but sceptical intelligence of Bolingbroke;
poor worn-out old Chesterfield, cold and courtly,
yet seeming so genial and humane, coming
again and again, and yet again; those reckless
wits, and leaders of the <i>ton</i> and all high
society, Bubb Doddington, afterwards Lord
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>Melcombe, and George Selwyn; the Duchess of
Montague, with her young daughter; Lady
Cardigan, often there, if her mother, Sarah
of Marlborough, were but seldom a visitor.
Charles Townshend, the great minister, often
came; and his friend, Lord Lyttleton, who
really must have been in sympathy with some
of the objects of the assembly, if we may judge
from his <i>Essay on the Conversion of St. Paul</i>, a
piece of writing which will never lose its value.
There you might have seen even the great
commoner, William Pitt, afterwards Earl of
Chatham; but we can understand why he would
be there to listen to the manifold notes of an
eloquence singularly resembling, in many particulars,
his own. And, in fact, where such persons
were present, we might be sure that the
entire nobility of the country was represented.
It might be tempting to loiter amidst these
scenes a little longer. It was an experiment
made by the Countess; she probably found it
almost a failure, and, in the course of a few
years, turned her attention to the larger ideas
connected with the evangelisation of England,
and the training of young men for the work of
the ministry. She long outlived all those
brilliant hosts she had gathered round her in
the prime of life. But we cannot doubt that
some good was effected by this preaching to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>“people of reputation.” Courtiers like Walpole
sneered, but it saved the movement to a
great degree, when it became popular, from
being suspected as the result of political faction;
and probably, as all these nobles and
gentry passed away to their various country
seats, when they heard of the preachers in
their neighbourhoods, and received the complaints
of the bishops and their clergy, with
some contempt for the messengers, they were
able to feel, and to say, that there was nothing
much more dreadful than the love of God and
His good will to men in their message.</p>

<p class='c007'>It seems a very sudden leap from the saloons
of the West End to a Lincolnshire kitchen; but
in the kitchen of that most romantic old vicarage
of Epworth, it has been truly said, the
most vigorous form of Methodism had its origin.
There, at the close of the seventeenth century,
and the commencement of the eighteenth,
lived and laboured old Samuel Wesley, the
father of John and Charles Wesley. Samuel
was in every sense a wonderful man, more wonderful
than most people know, though Mr.
Tyerman has done his best to set him forth in
a very clear and pleasant light, in his very entertaining
biography. Scholar, preacher, pastor,
and poet was Samuel Wesley; he led a life full
of romantic incident, and full of troubles, of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>which the two most notable are debts and
ghosts: debts, we must say, in passing, which
had more to do with unavoidable calamity
than with any personal imprudence. The
good man would have been shocked, and have
counted it one of his sorest troubles, could he,
in some real horoscope, have forecast what
“Jackey,” his son John, was to be. But it was
his wife, Susannah Wesley, patient housewife,
much-enduring, much-suffering woman, Mary
and Martha in one, saint as sacredly sweet as
any who have seemed worthy of a place in any
calendar of saints, Catholic or Protestant,
mother of children, all of whom were remarkable—two
of them wonderful, and a third highly
eminent—it was Susannah Wesley, whose
instinct for souls led her to look abroad over all
the parish in which she lived, with a tender,
spiritual affection; in her husband’s absence,
turning the large kitchen into a church, inviting
her poor neighbours into it, and, somewhat
at first to the distress of her husband, preaching
to and praying with them there. This brief
reference can only memorialise her name; read
John Kirk’s little volume, and learn to love
and revere “the mother of the Wesleys!” The
freedom and elevation of her religious life, and
her practical sagacity, it is not difficult to see,
must have given hints and ideas which took
<span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>shape and body in the large movement of which
her son John came to be regarded, and is still
regarded, as the patriarch. Thus Isaac Taylor
says, “The Wesleys’ mother was the mother
of Methodism in a religious and moral sense,
for her courage, her submissiveness to authority,
the high tone of her mind, its independence,
and its self-control, the warmth of her devotional
feelings, and the practical direction given
to them, came up, and were visibly repeated
in the character and conduct of her sons.”
Later on in life she became one of the wisest
advisers of her son, in his employment of the
auxiliaries to his own usefulness. Perhaps, if
we could see spirits as they are, we might see
in this woman a higher and loftier type of life
than in either of those who first received life
from her bosom; some of her quiet words have
all the passion and sweetness of Charles’s
hymns. Our space will not permit many quotations,
but take the following words, and the
sweet meditation in prose of the much-enduring,
and often patiently suffering lady in the
old world country vicarage, which read like
many of her son’s notes in verse: “If to esteem
and have the highest reverence for Thee; if
constantly and sincerely to acknowledge Thee
the supreme, and only desirable good, be to love
Thee, <span class='sc'>I do love Thee</span>! If to rejoice in Thy essential
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>majesty and glory; if to feel a vital joy
overspread and cheer the heart at each perception
of Thy blessedness, at every thought that
Thou art God, and that all things are in Thy
power; that there is none superior or equal to
Thee, be to love Thee, <span class='sc'>I do love Thee</span>! If
comparatively to despise and undervalue all the
world contains, which is esteemed great, fair,
or good; if earnestly and constantly to desire
Thee, Thy favour, Thy acceptance, Thyself,
rather than any, or all things Thou hast created,
be to love Thee, <span class='sc'>I do love Thee</span>!” At length
she died as she had lived, her last words to her
sons breathing the spirit of her singular life:
“Children, as soon as I am released, sing a
psalm of praise to God!”</p>

<p class='c007'>Thus, from the polite circles of London, from
the obscure old farm-like vicarage, the rude and
rough old English home, events were preparing
themselves. John Wesley was born in 1703;
the Countess of Huntingdon in 1707: near in
their birth time, how far apart the scenery and
the circumstances in which their eyes first
opened to the light. Whitefield was born
later, amidst the still less auspicious scenery of
the old Bell Inn, at Gloucester, in 1714. These
were undoubtedly among the foremost names
in the great palpitation of thought, feeling, and
holy action the country was to experience.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>Future chapters will show a number of other
names, which were simultaneously coming
forth and educating for the great conflict. So
it has always been, and singularly so, as illustrating
the order of Providence, and the way in
which it gives a new personality to the men
whom it designs to aid its purposes. In every
part of the country, all unknown to each other,
in families separated by position and taste, by
birth and circumstances, a band of workers was
preparing to produce an entire moral change in
the features of the country.</p>

</div>
<p class='c006'>It is remarkable that one of the very earliest
movements of the new evangelical succession
should manifest itself in Oxford—many minded
Oxford—whose distant spires and antique towers
have looked down through so many ages
upon the varying opinions which have surged
up around and within her walls. Lord Bacon
has somewhere said that the opinions, feelings,
and thoughts of the young men of any present
generation forecast the whole popular mind of
the future age. No remark can be more true,
as exhibited generally in fact. Thus it is not
too much to say that Oxford has usually been
a barometer of coming opinions: either by her
adhesion or antagonism to them, she has indicated
the pathway of the nearing weather, either
for calm or storm. It was so in the dark ages,
with the old scholastic philosophy; it was so
in the times immediately succeeding them: in
our own day, the great Tractarian movement,
with all its influences Rome-ward, arose in
Oxford; later still, the strong tendencies of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>high intellectual infidelity, and denial of the
sacred prerogatives and rights of the Holy
Scriptures, sent forth some of their earliest
notes from Oxford. Oxford has been likened
to the magnificent conservatory at Chatsworth,
where art combines with nature, and achieves
all that wealth and taste could command;
but the air is heavy and close, and rich as
the forms and colours are around the spectator,
there is depression and repression, even
a sense of oppression, upon the spirits, and we
are glad to escape into the breezy chase, and
among the old trees again. This is hardly
true of Oxford; no doubt the air is hushed, and
the influences combine to weigh down the mere
visitor by a sense of the hoariness of the past,
and the black antiquity and frost of ages; but
somehow there is a mind in Oxford which is
always alive—not merely a scholarly knowledge,
but a subtle apprehension of the coming
winds—even as certain creatures forebode and
know the coming storm before the rain falls or
the thunder rolls.</p>

<p class='c007'>We may presume that most of our readers
are acquainted with the designation, “the Oxford
Methodists;” but, perhaps, some are not
aware that the term was applied to a cluster of
young students, who, in a time when the university
was delivered over to the usual dissoluteness
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>and godless indifference of the age,
met together in each other’s rooms for the
purpose of sustaining each other in the determination
to live a holy life, and to bring their
mutual help to the reading and opening of the
Word of God. From different parts of the
country they met together there; when they
went forth, their works, their spheres were
different; but the power and the beauty of the
old college days seem to have accompanied
them through life; they realised the Divine life
as a real power from that commencement to the
close of their career, although it is equally
interesting to notice how the framework of
their opinions changed. Some of their names
are comparatively unknown now, but John and
Charles Wesley, George Whitefield, and James
Hervey, are well known; nor is John Gambold
unknown, nor Benjamin Ingham, who married
into the family of the Countess of Huntingdon,
of whom we will speak a little more particularly
when we visit the wild Yorkshire of those days;
nor Morgan of Christ Church, whose influence
is described as the most beautiful of all, a
young man of delicate constitution and intense
enthusiasm, who visited and talked with the
prisoners in the neighbourhood, visited the
cottages around to read and pray, left his
memory as a blessing upon his companions,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>and was very early called away to his reward.
This obscure life seems to have been one most
honoured in that which came to be called by
the wits of Oxford, “The Holy Club.”</p>

<p class='c007'>It was just about this time that Voltaire was
predicting that, in the next generation, Christianity
would be overthrown and unknown
throughout the whole civilised world. Christianity
has lived through, and long outlived
many such predictions. Voltaire had said, “It
took twelve men to set up Christianity; it
would only take one” (conceitedly referring to
himself) “to overthrow it;” but the work of
those whom he called the “twelve men” is
still of some account in the world—their words
are still of some authority, and there are very few
people on the face of the earth at this moment
who know much of, and fewer still who care
much for the wit of the vain old infidel. That
Voltaire’s prediction was not fulfilled, under
the Providential influence of that Divine Spirit
who never leaves us in our low estate, was greatly
owing to this obscure and despised “Holy
Club” of Oxford. These young men were feeling
their way, groping, as they afterwards admitted,
and somewhat in the dark, after those
experiences, which, as they were to be assurances
to themselves, should be also their most
certain means of usefulness to others.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>They were also called Methodists. It is
singular, but neither the precise etymology nor
the first appropriation of the term Methodist
has, we believe, ever been distinctly or satisfactorily
settled. Some have derived it from
an allusion in Juvenal to a quack physician,
some to a passage from the writings of Chrysostom,
who says, “to be a methodist is to be
beguiled,” and which was employed in a
pamphlet against Mr. Whitefield. Like some
other phrases, it is not easy to settle its first
import or importation into our language. Certainly
it is much older than the times to which
this book especially refers. It seems to be
even contemporary with the term Puritan,
since we find Spencer, the librarian of Sion
College under Cromwell, writing, “Where are
now our Anabaptists and plain pack-staff
Methodists, who esteem all flowers of rhetoric
in sermons no better than stinking weeds?” A
writer in the <i>British Quarterly</i> tells a curious
story how once in a parish church in Huntingdonshire,
he was listening to a clergyman,
notorious alike by his private character and
vehement intolerance, who was entertaining
his audience, on a week evening, by a discourse
from the text, Ephesians iv. 14, “Whereby
they lie in wait to deceive.” He said to his
people, “Now, you do not know Greek; I know
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>Greek, and I am going to tell you what this
text really says; it says, ‘they lie in wait to
make you Methodists.’ The word used here is
<i>Methodeian</i>, that is really the word that is used,
and that is really what Paul said, ‘They lie in
wait to make you Methodists’—a Methodist
means a deceiver, and one who deludes, cheats,
and beguiles.” The Grecian scholar was a
little at fault in his next allusion, for he proceeded
to quote that other text, “We are
not ignorant of his devices,” and seemed to be
under the impression that “device” was the
same word as that on which he had expended
his criticism. “Now,” said he, “you may be
ignorant, because you do not know Greek, but
we are not ignorant of his devices, that is, of
his methods, his deceivers, that is, his Methodists.”
In such empty wit and ignorant punning
it is very likely that the term had its origin.</p>

<p class='c007'>John Wesley passed through a long, singular,
and what we may call a parti-coloured experience,
before his mind came out into the
light. In those days his mind was a singular
combination of High Churchism, amounting to
what we should call Ritualism now, and mysticism,
both of which influences he brought
from Epworth: the first from his father, the
second from the strong fascination of the writings
of William Law. He found, however, in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>the “Holy Club” that which helped him. He
tells us how, when at Epworth, he travelled
many miles to see a “serious man,” and to take
counsel from him. “Sir,” said this person, as
if the right word were given to him at the right
moment, exactly meeting the necessities of the
man standing before him, “Sir, you wish to
serve God and to go to heaven: remember you
cannot serve Him alone; you must therefore
find companions, or make them. The Bible
knows nothing of solitary religion.” It must
be admitted that the enthusiasm of the mystics
has always been rather personal than social;
but the society at Oxford was almost monastic,
nor is it wonderful that, with the spectacle of
the dissolute life around them, these earnest
men adopted rules of the severest self-denial
and asceticism. John Wesley arrived in Oxford
first in 1720; he left for some time. Returning
home to assist his father, he became, as we

of Lincoln College.</p>

<p class='c007'>In 1733 George Whitefield arrived at Oxford,
then in his nineteenth year. Like most of this
band, Whitefield was, if not really, comparatively
poor, and dependent upon help to enable
him to pursue his studies; not so poor, perhaps,
as an illustrious predecessor in the same college
(Pembroke), who had left only the year
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>before, one Samuel Johnson, the state of whose
shoes excited so much commiseration in some
benevolent heart, that a pair of new ones was
placed outside his rooms, only, however, creating
surprise in the morning, when he was seen
indignantly kicking them up and down the
passage. Whitefield was not troubled by such
over-sensitive and delicate feelings; men are
made differently. Johnson’s rugged independence
did its work; and the easy facility and
amiable disposition, which could receive favours
without a sense of degradation, were very
essential to what Whitefield was to be. He,
however, when he came to Oxford, was caught
in the same glamour of mysticism as John Wesley.
But in this case it was Thomas à-Kempis
who had besieged the soul of the young
enthusiast; he was miserable, his life, his heart
and mind were crushed beneath this altogether
inhuman and unattainable standard for salvation.
He was a Quietist—what a paradox!—Whitefield
a Quietist! He was seeking salvation
by works of righteousness which he could
do. He was practising the severest austerities
and renouncing the claims of an external world;
he was living an internal life which God did not
intend should bring to him either rest or calm;
for, in that case, how could he ever have stirred
the deep foundations of universal sympathy?</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>But that heart, whose very mould was tenderness,
was easily called aside by the sight of
suffering; and there is an interesting story,
how, at this time, in one of his walks by the
banks of the river, in such a frame of mind
as we have described, he met a poor woman
whose appearance was discomposed. Naturally
enough, he talked with her, and found that her
husband was in the gaol in Oxford, that she
had run away from home, unable to endure any
longer the crying of her children from hunger,
and that she even then meditated drowning
herself. He gave her immediate relief, but
arranged with her to meet him, and see her
husband together in the evening at the prison.
He appears to have done them both
good, ministering to their temporal necessities;
he prayed with them, brought them to the
knowledge of the grace which saves, and late
on in life he says, “They are both now living,
and I trust will be my joy and crown of rejoicing
in the day of the Lord Jesus.” Happy is
the man to whose life such an incident as this
is given; it calls life away from its dreary
introspections, and sets it upon a trail of outwardness,
which is spiritual health; no one
can attain to much religious happiness until he
knows that he has been the means of good to
some suffering soul. Faith grows in us by the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>revelation that we have been used to do good
to others.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was about this time that Charles Wesley
met Whitefield moodily walking through the
college corridors. The misery of his appearance
struck him, and he invited him to his
rooms to breakfast. The memory of the meeting
never passed away; Charles Wesley refers
to it in his elegy on Whitefield. In a short
time he leaped forth into spiritual freedom, and
almost immediately became, youth as he was,
preacher, and we may almost say, apostle.
The change in his mind seems to have been as
instantaneous and as luminous as Luther’s at
Erfurt. Whitefield was at work, commencing
upon his own great scale, long before the Wesleys.
John had to go to America, and to be
entangled there by his High Church notions;
and then there were his Moravian proclivities,
so that, altogether, years passed by before he
found his way out into a light so clear as to be
able to reflect it on the minds of others.</p>

<p class='c007'>To some of the members of this “Holy Club,”
we shall not be able to refer again; we must,
therefore, mention them now. Especially is
some reference due to James Hervey; his name
is now rather a legend and tradition than an
active influence in our religious literature; but
how popular once, do not the oldest memories
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>amongst us well know? On some important
points of doctrine he parted company from his
friends and fellow-students, the Wesleys. John
Wesley used to declare that he himself was not
converted till his thirty-seventh year, so that
we must modify any impressions we may have
from similar declarations made by the amiable
Vicar of Weston Favel: the term conversion,
used in such a sense, in all probability means
simply a change in the point of view, an alteration
of opinion, giving a more clear apprehension
of truth. Hervey was always infirm in
health, tall, spectral; and, while possessing a
mind teeming with pleasing and poetic fancies,
and a power of perceiving happy analogies, we
should regard him as singularly wanting in that
fine solvent of all true genius, geniality. Hence,
all his letters read like sermons; but his poor, infirm
frame was the tabernacle of an intensely fervent
soul. Shortly after his settlement in his village
in Northamptonshire he was recommended
by his physician to follow the plough, that he
might receive the scent of the fresh earth; a curious
recommendation, but it led to a conversation
with the ploughman, which completely overturned
the young scholar’s scheme of theology.
The ploughman was a member of the Church
of Dr. Doddridge, afterwards one of Hervey’s
most intimate friends. As they walked together,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>the young minister asked the old
ploughman what he thought was the hardest
thing in religion? The ploughman very respectfully
returned the question. Hervey replied,
“I think the hardest thing in religion is
to deny sinful self,” and he proceeded, at some
length, of course, to dilate upon and expound
the difficulty, from which our readers will see
that, at this time, his mind must have been
under the same influences as those we meet in
<i>The Imitation</i> of Thomas à-Kempis.  “No,
sir,” said the old ploughman, “the hardest
thing in religion is to deny righteous self,” and
he proceeded to unfold the principles of his
faith.  At the time, Hervey thought the
ploughman a fool, but the conversation was not
forgotten, and he declares that it was this
view of things which created for him a new
creed. Our readers, perhaps, know his <i>Theron
and Aspasia</i>: we owe that book to the conversation
with the ploughman; all its pages, alive
with descriptions of natural scenery, historical
and classical allusion, and glittering with chromatic
fancy through the three thick volumes,
are written for the purpose of unfolding and
enforcing—to put it in old theological phraseology—the
imputed and imparted righteousness
of Christ, the great point of divergence in teaching
between Hervey and John Wesley.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>Thus the term Methodism cannot, any more
than Christianity, be contented with, or contained
in one particular line of opinion. Thus,
for instance, among the members of the “Holy
Club” we find the two Wesleys and others distinctly
Arminian—the apostles of that form of
thought which especially teaches us that we
must attain to the grace of God; while Whitefield
first, and Hervey afterwards, became the
teachers of that doctrine which announces the
irresistible grace of God as that which is outside
of us, and comes down upon us. No doubt
the doctrines were too sharply separated by
their respective leaders. In the ultimate issue,
both believed alike that all was of grace, and
all of God; but experience makes every man’s
point of view; as he feels, so he sees. The
grand thought about all these men in this
Great Revival was that they believed in, and
untiringly and with immense confidence announced,
that which smote upon the minds of
their hearers almost like a new revelation; in
an age of indifference and Deism they declared
that “the grace of God hath appeared unto all
men.”</p>

<p class='c007'>There is a very interesting anecdote showing
how, about this time, even the massive and
sardonic intellect of Lord Bolingbroke almost
gave way. He was called upon once by a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>High Church dignitary, his intimate friend, Dr.
Church, Vicar of Battersea, and Prebendary of
St. Paul’s, to whom we have already referred as
from the first opposed to the Revival, and, to
the doctor’s amazement, he found Bolingbroke
reading Calvin’s <i>Institutes</i>. The peer asked
the preacher, the infidel the professed Christian,
what he thought of it. “Oh,” said the
doctor, “we think nothing of such antiquated
stuff; we think it enough to preach the importance
of morality and virtue, and have long
given up all that talk about Divine grace.”
Bolingbroke’s face and eyes were a study at all
times, but we could wish to have seen him turn
in his chair, and fix his eyes on the vicar as he
said: “Look you, doctor. You know I don’t
believe the Bible to be a Divine revelation, but
those who do can never defend it but upon the
principle of the doctrine of Divine grace. To say
the truth, there have been times when I have been
almost persuaded to believe it upon this view of
things; and there is one argument I have felt
which has gone very far with me on behalf of its
authenticity, which is, that the belief in it
exists upon earth even when committed to the
care of such as you, who pretend to believe in
it, and yet deny the only principle upon which
it is defensible.” The worn-out statesman and
hard-headed old peer hit the question of his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>own day, and forecast all the sceptical strife of
ours; for all such questions are summed in one,
Is there supernatural grace, and has that grace
appeared unto men? This was the one faith
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>of all these revivalists. The world was eager
to hear it, for the aching heart of the world
longs to believe that it is true. The conversation
we have recited shows that even Bolingbroke
wished that it might be true.</p>

<div class='ic002'>
<p><span class='small'>WESTON FAVEL CHURCH,<br />(<i>Where James Hervey Preached.</i>)</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The new creed of Hervey changed the whole
character of his preaching. The little church
of Weston Favel, a short distance from the
town of Northampton, became quite a shrine
for pilgrimages; he was often compelled to
preach in the churchyard. He was assuredly an
intense lover of natural scenery, a student of
natural theology of the old school. His writing
is now said to be meretricious and gaudy.
One critic says that children will always prefer
a red to a white sugar-plum, and that the tea
is nicer to them when they drink it from a
cup painted with coloured flowers; and this,
perhaps, not unfairly, describes the style of
Hervey; we have prettiness rather than power,
elegant disquisition rather than nervous expression,
which is all the more wonderful, as he
must have been an accomplished Latin scholar.
But he had a mind of gorgeous fullness, and his
splendid conceptions bore him into a train of
what now seem almost glittering extravagances.
Hervey was in the manner of his life
a sickly recluse, and we easily call up the figure
of the old bachelor—for he never married—alternately
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>watching his saucepan of gruel on
the fire, and his favourite microscope on the
study table. He was greatly beloved by the
Countess of Huntingdon, perhaps yet more by
Lady Fanny Shirley—the subject of Walpole’s
sneer. He was, no doubt, the writer of the
movement, and its thoughts in his books must
have seemed like “butter in a lordly dish.”
But his course was comparatively brief; his
work was accomplished at the age of forty-five.
He died in his chair, his last words, “Lord,
now lettest Thou Thy servant depart in peace,
for mine eyes have seen Thy most comfortable
salvation;” shortly after, “The conflict is over;
all is done;” the last words of all, “Precious
salvation.” And so passed away one of the
most amiable and accomplished of all the revivalists.</p>

<p class='c007'>John Gambold, although ever an excellent
and admirable man, lived the life rather of a
secluded mystic, than that of an active reformer.
He became a minister of the Church of England,
but afterwards left that communion, not
from any dissensions either from the doctrines
or the discipline of the Church, but simply
because he found his spiritual relationships
more in harmony with those of the Moravians,
of whose Church he died a bishop. We presume
few readers are acquainted with his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>poetical works; nor are there many words
among them of remarkable strength. <i>The
Mystery of Life</i> is certainly pleasingly impressive;
and his epitaph on himself deserves
quotation:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Ask not, ‘Who ended here his span?’</div>
      <div class='line in1'>His name, reproach, and praise, was Man.</div>
      <div class='line in1'>‘Did no great deeds adorn his course?’</div>
      <div class='line in1'>No deed of his but showed him worse:</div>
      <div class='line in1'>One thing was great, which God supplied,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>He suffered human life—and died.</div>
      <div class='line in1'>‘What points of knowledge did he gain?’</div>
      <div class='line in1'>That life was sacred all—and vain:</div>
      <div class='line in1'>‘Sacred, how high? and vain, how low?’</div>
      <div class='line in1'>He knew not here, but died to know.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c016'>Such were some of the men who went forth
from Oxford. Meantime, as the flame of revival
was spreading, Oxford again starts into singular
notice; how the “Holy Club” escaped
official censure and condemnation seems
strange, but in 1768 the members of a similar
club were, for meeting together for prayer and
reading the Scriptures, all summarily expelled
from the university. Their number was seven.
Several of the heads of houses spoke in their
favour, the principal of their own hall, Dr.
Dixon, moved an amendment against their expulsion,
on the ground of their admirable conduct
and exemplary piety. Not a word was
alleged against them, only that some of them
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>were the sons of tradesmen, and that all of them
“held Methodistical tenets, taking upon them
to pray, read and expound the Scriptures, and
sing hymns at private houses.” These practices
were considered as hostile to the Articles and
interests of the Church of England, and sentence
was pronounced against them.</p>

<p class='c007'>Of course this expulsion created a great agitation
at the time; and as the moral character
of the young men was so perfectly unimpeachable,
it no doubt greatly aided the cause of the
Revival. Dr. Horne, Bishop of Norwich, author
of the Commentary <i>On the Psalms</i>—no Methodist,
although an admirable and evangelical
man—denounced the measure in a pamphlet
in the strongest terms. The well-known wit
and Baptist minister of Devonshire Square in
London, Macgowan, lashed the transaction in
his piece called <i>The Shaver</i>. All the young
men seem to have turned out well. Some, like
Thomas Jones, who afterwards became curate
of Clifton, and married the sister of Lady
Austen, Cowper’s friend—found admission into
the Church of England; the others instantly
found help from the Countess of Huntingdon,
who sent them to finish their studies at her
college in Trevecca, and afterwards secured
them places in connection with her work of
evangelisation. The transaction gives a singular
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>idea of what Oxford was in 1768, and prepares
us for the vehement persecutions by
which the representatives of Oxford all over
the country armed themselves to resist the
Revival, whilst it justifies our designation of
this chapter, “New Lights and Old Lanterns.”</p>

  <h2 id='ch04' class='c004'>CHAPTER IV<br /> <br /><span class='small'>CAST OUT FROM THE CHURCH—TAKING TO THE FIELDS.</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c006'>It was field-preaching, preaching in the open
air, which first gave national distinctiveness to
the Revival, and constituted it a movement.
Assuredly any occasions of excitement we have
known, give no idea whatever of the immense
agitations which speedily rolled over the country,
from one end to the other, when these great
revivalists began their work in the fields. And
the excitement continued, rolling on through
London, and through the counties of England,
from the west to the north, not for days, weeks,
or months merely, but through long years, until
the religious life of the land was entirely rekindled,
and its morals and manners re-moulded;
and all this, especially in its origination,
without money, no large sums being subscribed
or guaranteed to sustain the work. The work
was done, not only without might or power, but
assuredly in the very teeth of the malevolence
of might and of power; nor is it too much to
say that it probably would not have been done,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>could not have been done, had the churches,
chapels, and great cathedrals been thrown open
to the preachers.</p>

<p class='c007'>It seems a singular thing to say, but we
should speak of Whitefield as the Luther of this
Great Revival, and of Wesley as its Calvin.
Both in the quality of their work and in their
relation in point of time, this analogy is not so
unnatural as it perhaps seems at first. The impetuosity
and passion, the vehemence and
sleepless vigilance of Whitefield first broke
open the way; the calm, cautious, frequently
even nervously timid intelligence of Wesley
organised the work.</p>

<p class='c007'>How could a writer, in a recent number of
the <i>Edinburgh Review</i>, say: “It is a great
mistake to complain, as so many do, that the
Church cast out the Wesleys. We have seen
at the beginning how kindly, and even cordially,
they were treated by the leading members
of the episcopate.” Surely any history of
Methodism contradicts this statement. Bishop
Benson, indeed, ordained Whitefield, but he
bitterly lamented to the Countess of Huntingdon
that he had done so, attributing to him
what seemed to the Bishop the mischief of the
evangelical movement. “My lord,” said the
Countess, “mark my words: when you are on
your dying bed, that will be one of the few ordinations
<span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>you will reflect upon with complaisance.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The words were, in a remarkable degree,
prophetic; when the Bishop was on his death-bed
he sent ten guineas to Mr. Whitefield as a
token of his “regard, veneration, and affection,”
and begged the great field-preacher to
remember him in prayer. If the bishops were
kind and cordial to the first Methodists, they
certainly took a singular way of dissembling
their love. For instance, Bishop Lavington,
of Exeter, whose well-known two volumes on
Methodism are really a curiosity of episcopal
scurrility, was in a passion with everything that
looked like Whitefieldism in his diocese. Mr.
Thomson, the Vicar of St. Gennys, was a dissipated
clergyman, a character of known immorality;
he was a rich man, and not dependent
upon his vicarage. In the midst of his sinful
life conscience was arrested; he became converted;
he countenanced and threw open his
pulpit to Mr. Whitefield; he became now as remarkable
for his devout life and fervent gospel
preaching as he had been before for his ungodliness.
What made it all the worse was, that
he was a man of real genius. Now all his
brethren in the ministry disowned him, and
closed their pulpits against him; and presently
Bishop Lavington summoned him to appear
<span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>before him to answer the charges made against
him by his brethren for his Methodistical practices.
“Sir,” said the Bishop, in the course of
conversation, “if you pursue these practices,
and countenance Whitefield, I will strip your
gown from off you.” Mr. Thomson had on his
gown at the time—more frequently worn by
ministers of the Church then than now. To
the amazement of the Bishop, Mr. Thomson
exclaimed, “I will save your lordship the
trouble!” He took off his gown, dropped it at
the Bishop’s feet, saying, “My lord, I can
preach without a gown!” and before the Bishop
could recover from his astonishment he was
gone. This was an instance, however, in
which the Bishop was so decidedly in the
wrong that he sent for the vicar again, apologised
to him; and the circumstance, indeed,
led to the entertainment by the Bishop of
views which were somewhat milder with reference
to Methodism than those which still give
notoriety to his name.</p>

<p><span class='small'>GEORGE WHITEFIELD.</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Southey<a id='r5' /><a href='#f5' class='c012'><b>[5]</b></a>, in his certainly not impartial volumes,
admits that, for the most part, the condition
of the clergy was dreadful; it is not wonderful
that they closed their churches against
the innovators. There was, for instance, the
Vicar of Colne, the Rev. George White; when
the preachers came into his neighbourhood, it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>was his usual practice to call his parishioners
together by the beat of a drum, to issue a
proclamation at the market-cross, and enlist a
mob for the defence of the Church against the
Methodists. Here is a copy of the proclamation,
a curiosity in its way: “Notice is hereby
given that if any man be mindful to enlist in
His Majesty’s service, under the command of
the Rev. Mr. George White, Commander-in-Chief,
and John Bannister, Lieutenant-General
of His Majesty’s forces for the defence of the
Church of England, and the support of the
manufactory in and about Colne, both which
are now in danger, let him repair to the drumhead
at the Cross, where each man shall receive
a pint of ale in advance, and all other
proper encouragements.” Such are some of the
instances, which might be multiplied to any
extent, showing the reception given to the revivalists
by the clergy of the time. But let no
reader suppose that, in reciting these things,
we are willingly dwelling upon facts not creditable
to the Church, or that we forget how
many of her most admirable members have
made an abundant <i>amende honorable</i> by their
eulogies since; nor are we forgetting that Nonconformist
chapels, whose cold respectability
of service and theology were sadly outraged by
the new teachers, were not more readily
<span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>opened than the churches were to men with
whom the Word of the Lord was as a fire, or
as a hammer to break the rock in pieces.<a id='r6' /><a href='#f6' class='c012'><b>[6]</b></a>
Whitefield soon felt his power. Immediately
after his ordination, he in some way became for
a time an occasional supply at the chapel in the
Tower; he found a straggling congregation of
twenty or thirty hearers; after a service or two
the place was overflowing, and remained so.
During his short residence in that neighbourhood
the youth continued throughout the
whole week preaching to the soldiers, preaching
to prisoners, holding services on Sunday
mornings for young men before the ordinary
service. He was still ostensibly at Oxford; a
profitable living was offered to him in London,
and instantly declined. He went to Gloucester,
to Bristol, to Kingswood. Of course it is
impossible to follow Whitefield step by step
through his career; we can only rapidly bring
out a crayon sketch of the chief features of his
work. He made voyages to Georgia; voyaging
was no pastime in those days, and he spent a
great amount of time in transit to and fro on
the seas; our business with him is chiefly as
the first field-preacher; and Kingswood, near
Bristol, appears to have been the first place
where this great work was to be tried. It was
then, what it is still, a region of rough collieries,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>the Black Country of the West; the people
themselves were of the roughest order. Whitefield
spoke at Bristol, to some friends, of his
probable speedy embarkation to preach the
Gospel among the Indians of America; and
they said to him, “What need of going abroad
to do this? Have we not Indians enough at
home? If you have a mind to convert Indians,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>there are colliers enough in Kingswood!” A
savage race! As to taking to the fields in this
instance, it was simply a necessity; there were
no churches from whence the preacher could be
ejected. Try to realize it: the heathen society,
indoctrinated only in brutal sports; the rough,
black labour only typical of the rough, black
minds, the rough, black souls. Surely he must
have been a very brave man; nor was he one
at all of that order of apostles whose native
roughness is well fitted, it seems, to challenge
roughness to civility.</p>

</div>

<p class='c007'>Whitefield was a perfect gentleman, of manners
most affectionate and amiable; altogether
the most unlikely creature, it seems, to rise triumphant
over the execrations of a mighty mob.
The oratory of Whitefield seems to us almost
the greatest mystery in the history of eloquence:
his voice must have been wonderful;
its strength was overwhelming, but it was not
a roar; its modulations and inflections were
equal to its strength, so that it had the all-commanding
tones of a bell in its clearness, and
all the modulations of an organ in its variety
and sweetness. Kingswood only stands as a
representative of crowds of other such places,
where savages fell before the enchantment of
his sweet music. Read any accounts of him,
and it will be seen that we do not exaggerate
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>in speaking of him as the very Orpheus of the
pulpit. Assuredly, as it has been said Orpheus,
by the power of his music, drew trees, stones,
the frozen mountain-tops, and the floods to
bow to his melody, so men, “stockish, hard,
and full of rage,” felt a change pass over their
nature, as they came under the spell of Whitefield.
Yet, perhaps, he would not have gone
to Kingswood had he not been inhibited from
preaching in the Bristol churches. He had
preached in St. Mary Redcliff, and the following
day had preached opening sermons in the
parish church of SS. Philip and Jacob, and then
he was called before the Chancellor of the diocese,
who asked him for his licence by which he
was permitted to preach in that diocese. Whitefield
said he was an ordained minister of the
Church of England, and as to the special licence,
it was obsolete. “Why did you not ask,” he said,
“for the licence of the clergyman who preached
for you last Thursday?” The Chancellor replied,
“That is no business of yours.” Whitefield
said, “There is a canon forbidding clergymen
to frequent taverns and play at cards,
why is that not enforced?” The Chancellor
evaded this, but charged Whitefield with
preaching false doctrine; Whitefield replied that
he preached what he knew to be the truth, and
he would continue to preach. “Then,” said the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>Chancellor, “I will excommunicate you!” The
end of it was that all the city churches were
shut against him. “But,” he says, “if they
were all open, they would not contain half
the people who come to hear. So at three in
the afternoon I went to Kingswood among the
colliers.” Whitefield laid his case in a very respectful
letter, before the Bishop, but on he
went. As to Kingswood, tears poured down
the black faces of the colliers; the great audiences
are described as being drenched in
tears. Whitefield himself was in a passion of
tears. “How can I help weeping,” he said to
them, “when you have not wept for yourselves?”
And they began to weep. Thus in 1739 began
the mighty work at Kingswood, which has been
a great Methodist colony from that day to this.
That was a good morning’s work for the cause
of Christ when the Chancellor shut the doors
of the churches of Bristol against the brave
and beautiful preacher, and threatened to excommunicate
him. Was it not said of old,
“Thou makest the wrath of man to praise
Thee”?</p>

<p class='c007'>Now, then, see him girt and road-ready; we
might be sure that the example of the Chancellor
of Bristol would be pretty generally
followed. The old ecclesiastical corporations
set themselves in array against him; but how
<span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>futile the endeavour! Their canons and
rubrics were like the building of hedges to
confine an eagle, and they only left him without
a choice—without any choice but to fulfil
his instinct for souls, and to soar. Other “little
brief authorities,” mayors, aldermen, and such
like, issued their fulminations. Coming to
Basingstoke, the mayor, one John Abbott,
inhibited him. John Abbott seems to have
been a burly butcher. The intercourse and
correspondence between the two is very
humorously characteristic; but, although it
gives an insight as to the antagonism which
frequently awaited Whitefield, it is too long to
quote in this brief sketch. The butcher-mayor
was coarse and insolent; Whitefield never lost
his sweet graciousness; writing to abusive
butchers or abusive bishops, as in his reply to
Lavington, he never lost his temper, never
indulged in satire, never exhibits any great
marks of genius, writes straight to the point,
simply vindicates himself and his course, never
retracts, never apologises, goes straight on.</p>

<p class='c007'>There is no other instance of a preacher who
was so equally at home and equally impressive
and commanding in the most various and
dissimilar circles and scenes; it is significant of
the notice he excited that his name occurs so
frequently in the correspondence of that cold
<span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>and heartless man and flippant sneerer, Horace
Walpole, whose allusions to him are usually
disgraceful; but so it was, he was equally commanding
in the polished and select circles of
the drawing-room, surrounded by dukes and
duchesses, great statesmen and philosophers,
or in the large old tabernacle or parish church,
surrounded by more orderly and saintly worshippers,
or in nature’s vast and grand cathedrals,
with twenty or thirty thousand people
around him.</p>

<p class='c007'>From the day when he went to Kingswood,
we may run a rapid eye along the perspective
of his career—in fields, on heaths, and on commons,
it was the same everywhere; from his
intense life we might find many scenes for
description: take one or two. On the breast
of the mountain, the trees and hedges full of
people, hushed to profound silence, the open
firmament above him, the prospect of adjacent
fields—the sight of thousands on thousands of
people; some in coaches, some on horseback,
and all affected, or drenched in tears. Sometimes
evening approaches, and then he says,
“Beneath the twilight it was too much for me,
and quite overcame me.” There was one
night never to be forgotten. While he was
preaching it lightened exceedingly; his spirit
rose on the tempest; his voice tolled out the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>doom and decay hanging over all nature; he
preached the warnings and the consolations of
the coming of the Son of man. The thunder
broke over his head, the lightning shone along
the preacher’s path, it ran along the ground in
wild glares from one part of heaven to the
other; the whole audience shook like the
leaves of a forest in the wind, whilst high
amidst the thunders and the lightnings, the
preacher’s voice rose, exclaiming, “Oh; my
friends, the wrath of God! the wrath of God!”
Then his spirit seemed to pass serenely right
through the tempest, and he talked of Christ,
who swept the wrath away; and then he told
how he longed for the time when Christ should
be revealed, amidst the flaming fire, consuming
all natural things. “Oh,” exclaimed he, “that
my soul may be in a like flame when He shall
come to call me!” Can we realize what his
soul must have been who could burn with such
seraphic ardours in the midst of such scenes?</p>

<p><span class='small'>WHITEFIELD PREACHING IN LONDON.</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>So he opened the way everywhere, by his
field-preaching, for John Wesley. Truly it has
been said, “Whitefield, and not Wesley, is the
prominent figure in the opening of the Methodist
movement;” and the time we must assign
to this first popular agitation is the winter of
1738-39. The two men were immensely different.
To Whitefield the preaching was no light
<span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>work; it was not talking. After one of his
sermons, drenched through, he would lie down,
spent, sobbing, exhausted, death-like: John
Wesley, after one of his most effective sermons,
in which he also had shaken men’s souls, would
just quietly mount his little pony, and ride off
to the next village or town, reading his book as
he went, or stopping by the way to pluck
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>curious flowers or simples from the hedges;
the poise of their spirits was so different. All
great movements need two men, Moses and
Aaron; the prophet Elijah must go before, “to
restore all things.” Whitefield lived in the
immediate neighbourhood and breathed the air
of essential truth; Wesley looked at men, and
saw how all remained undone until the work
took coherency and shape. As he says, “I was
convinced that preaching like an apostle, without
joining together those that are awakened,
and training them up in the ways of God, is
only begetting children for the murderer.”
Whitefield preached like an apostle; the scenes
we have described appear charming rural
scenes, in which men’s hearts were bowed and
hushed before him; but there were widely
different scenes when he defied the devil, and
sought to win his victims away, even in fairs
and wakes—the most wild and dissolute periodical
pests and nuisances of the age. Rough
human nature went down before him, as in the
instance of the man who came with heavy
stones to pelt him, and suddenly found his
hands as it were tied, and himself in tears,
and, at the close, went up to the preacher, and
said, “I came here only to break your head,
and you have broken my heart!”</p>

<p class='c007'>But the roughs of London seem to have been
<span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>worse than the roughs of Kingswood; and we
cannot wonder that men like Walpole, and
even polite and refined religious men, thought
that a man who could go right into St. Bartholomew’s
Fair, in Moorfields, and Finsbury,
take his station among drummers, trumpeters,
merry-andrews, harlequins, and all kinds of
wild beasts, must be “mad”; it must have
seemed the height of fanaticism, like preaching
to a real Gadarene swinery. All the historians
of the movement—Sir James Stephen, Dr.
Abel Stevens, Dr. Southey, Isaac Taylor, and
others, recite with admiration the story of the
way in which he wrestled successfully with the
merry-andrews. He began to preach at six
o’clock in the morning; stones, dirt, rotten
eggs were hurled at him. “My soul was
among lions,” he says; but the marvellous
voice overcame, and he went on speaking, and
we know how tenderly he would speak to
them, of their own miseries, and the dangers of
their own sins; the great multitude—it was
between twenty and thirty thousand—“became
like lambs;” he finished, went away, and,
in the wilder time—in the afternoon—he came
again. In the meantime there had been organisations
to put him down: here was a man with
a long heavy whip to strike the preacher;
there was a recruiting sergeant who had been
<span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>engaged with drum and fife to interrupt him.
As he appeared on the outskirts of the crowd,
Whitefield, who well knew how to catch the
humour of the people too, exclaimed, “Make
way for the king’s officer!” and the mob divided,
while, to his surprise, the recruiting officer, with
his drum, found himself immediately beneath
Whitefield; it was easy to manage him now.
The crowd around roared like wild beasts; it
must have been a tremendous scene. Will it
be believed—it seems incredible—that he continued
there, preaching, praying, singing, until
the night fell? He won a decided victory, and
the next day received no fewer than a thousand
notes from persons, “brands plucked from the
burning,” who spoke of the convictions through
which they had passed, and implored the
preacher to remember them in his prayers.</p>

<p class='c007'>This was in Moorfields, in which neighbourhood
since, the followers both of Wesley and
of Whitefield have found their tabernacles and
most eminent fields of usefulness. Many have
attempted fair-preaching since Whitefield’s
day, but not, we believe, with much success;
it needs a remarkable combination of powers to
make such efforts successful. Whitefield was
able to attempt to outbid the showmen, merry-andrews,
and harlequins, and he succeeded.
No wonder they called him a fanatic; he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>might have said, “If we be beside ourselves, it
is for God, that by all means we may save
some!”</p>

<p class='c007'>But what we have been especially desirous
that our readers should note is, that these more
vehement manifestations of Methodism were
not the result of any methodised plan, but were
a simple yielding to, and taking possession of
circumstances; it was as if “the Spirit of the
Lord” came down upon the leaders, and “carried
them whither they knew not.”</p>

</div>
<p class='c006'>Lord Macaulay’s verdict upon John Wesley,
that he possessed a “genius for government
not inferior to that of Richelieu,” received
immediate demonstration when he came
actively into the movement, and has been
abundantly confirmed since his death, in the
history of the society which he founded. It
has been said that all institutions are the prolonged
shadow of one mind, and that by the
inclusiveness, or power of perpetuity in the institution,
we may know the mind of the
founder. Much of our last chapter was devoted
to some attempt to realise the place and power
of Whitefield;<a id='r7' /><a href='#f7' class='c012'><b>[7]</b></a> what he was in relation to the
Revival may be defined by the remark, often
made, and by capable critics, that while there
have been multitudes of better sermon-makers,
it is uncertain whether the Church ever had so
great a pulpit orator. In Wesley’s mind everything
became structural and organic; he was a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>mighty master of administration; but he also
followed Whitefield’s example, and took to the
fields; and very great, indeed, amazing results,
followed his ministry.</p>

<div class='footnote c013' id='f7'>
<p class='c014'><span class='label'><a href='#r7'>7</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>See Chapter <a href='#ch14'>XIV</a>. for his place and power in America.</p>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Many of the incidents which are impressive
and amusing show the difference between the
men. Whitefield overwhelmed the people:
Wesley met insolence and antagonism by some
sharp, concise, and cuttingly appropriate retort,
which was remarkable, considering his
stature. But both his presence and his words
must have been unusually commanding: “Be
silent, or begone,” he turned round sharply
and said once to some violent disturbers, and
they were obedient to the command.</p>

<p class='c007'>Wesley’s rencontre with Beau Nash at Bath
is a fair illustration of his quiet and almost obscurely
sarcastic method of confounding a
troublesome person. Preaching in the open air
at Bath, the King of Bath, the Master of the
Ceremonies, Nash, was so unwise as to attempt
to put down the apostolic man. Nash’s character
was bad; it was that of an idle, heartless,
licentious dangler on the skirts of high society.
He appeared in the crowd, and authoritatively
asked Wesley by what right he dared to stand
there. The congregation was not wholly of
the poor; there were a number of fashionable
and noble persons present, and among them
<span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>many with whom this attack had been pre-arranged,
and who expected to see the discomfiture
of the Methodist by the courtly and
fashionable old dandy. Wesley replied to the
question simply and quietly that he stood there
by the authority of Jesus Christ, conveyed to
him “by the present Archbishop of Canterbury,
when he laid hands on me and said,
‘Take thou authority to preach the Gospel!’”
Nash began to bustle and to be turbulent, and
he exclaimed, “This is contrary to Act of Parliament;
this is a conventicle.” “Sir,” said
Wesley, “the Act you refer to applies to seditious
meetings: here is no sedition, no shadow
of sedition; the meeting is not, therefore, contrary
to the Act.” Nash stormed, “I say it is;
besides, your preaching frightens people out of
their wits.” “Sir,” said Wesley, “give me
leave to ask, Did you ever hear me preach?”
“No!” “How, then, can you judge of what you
have never heard?” “Sir, by common report.”
“Common report is not enough,” said Wesley;
“again give me leave to ask is your name not
Nash?” “My name is Nash.” And then the
reader must imagine Wesley’s thin, clear,
piercing voice, cutting through the crowd:
“Sir, I dare not judge of <i>you</i> by common report.”
There does not seem much in it, but
the effect was overwhelming. Nash tried to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>bully it out a little; but, to make his discomfiture
complete, the people took up the case, and
especially one old woman, whose daughter had
come to grief through the fop, in her way so set
forth his sins that he was glad to retreat in dismay.
On another occasion, when attempts
were made to assault Wesley, there was some
uncertainty about his person, and the assailants
were saying, “Which is he? which is
he?” he stood still as he was walking down
the crowded street, turned upon them, and
said, “I am he;” and they instantly fell back,
awed into involuntary silence and respect.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is characteristic that while Whitefield
simply took to the work of field-preaching, and
preaching in the open air, and troubled himself
very little about finding or giving reasons for
the irregularity of the proceeding, Wesley defended
the practice with formidable arguments.
It is remarkable that the practice should have
been deemed so irregular, or should need vindication,
considering that our Lord had given
to it the sanction of His example, and that it
had been adopted by the apostles and fathers,
the greatest of the Catholic preachers, and the
reformers of every age. A history of field and
street-preaching would form a large and interesting
chapter of Church history. Southey
quotes a very happy series of arguments from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>one of Wesley’s appeals: “What need is
there,” he says, speaking for his antagonists,
“of this preaching in the fields and streets?
Are there not churches enough to preach in?”
“No, my friend, there are not, not for us to
preach in. You forget we are not suffered to
preach there, else we should prefer them to any
place whatever.” “Well, there are ministers
enough without you.” “Ministers enough, and
churches enough! For what? To reclaim all
the sinners within the four seas? and one plain
reason why these sinners are never reclaimed
is this: they never come into a church. Will
you say, as some tender-hearted Christians I
have heard, ‘Then it is their own fault; let
them die and be damned!’ I grant it may be
their own fault, but the Saviour of souls came
after us, and so we ought to seek to save that
which is lost.” He went on to confess the
irregularity, but he retorted that those persons
who compelled him to be irregular had no right
to censure him for irregularity. “Will they
throw a man into the dirt,” said he, “and beat
him because he is dirty? Of all men living
those clergymen ought not to complain who
believe I preach the Gospel; if they will not ask
me to preach in their churches, they are
accountable for my preaching in the fields.”
This is a fair illustration of the neat shrewdness,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>the compact, incisive common sense of Wesley’s
mind. Thus he argued himself into that
sphere of labour which justified him in after
years in saying, without any extravagance,
“The world is my parish.”</p>

<p class='c007'>We have said the Revival became conservative.
It is true the Countess of Huntingdon
did much to make it so; but it assumed a shape
of vitality, and a force of coherent strength,
chiefly from the touch of Wesley’s administrative
mind. The present City Road Chapel,
which was opened in 1776, opposite Bunhill
Fields Burial Ground, is probably the first
illustration of this fact; it stands where stood
the Foundry—time-honoured spot in the history
of Methodism. It stood in Moorfields; the
City Road was a mere lane then. The building
had been used by government for casting
cannon; it was a rude ruin. Wesley purchased
it and the site at the very commencement of
his work, in 1739; he turned it into a temple.
As the years passed on it became the cradle of
London Methodism, accommodating fifteen
hundred people. Until within twenty years of
Wesley’s purchase this had been a kind of
Woolwich Arsenal to the government; it became
a temple of peace, and here came “band-rooms,”
school-rooms, book-rooms—the first
saplings of Methodist usefulness.</p>

</div>

<p class='c007'>It has been truly said by a writer in the <i>British
Quarterly</i>, that the most romantic lives of
the saints of the Roman Catholic calendar do
not present a more startling succession of
incidents than those which meet us in the life
and labours of Wesley. Romish stories claim
<span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>that Blessed Raymond, of Pegnafort, spread
his cloak upon the sea to transport him across
the water, sailing one hundred and sixty miles
in six hours, and entering his convent through
closed doors! The devout and zealous Francis
Xavier spent three whole days in two different
places at the same time, preaching all the
while! Rome shines out in transactions like
these: Wesley does not; but he seems to
have been almost ubiquitous, and he moves
with a rapidity reminding us of that flying
angel who had the everlasting Gospel to preach,
and he shines alike in his conflicts with nature
and the still wilder tempests caused by the
passions of men. We read of his travelling,
through the long wintry hours, two hundred
and eighty miles on horseback, in six days; it
was a wonderful feat in those times. When
Wesley first began his itinerancy there were no
turnpikes in the country; but before he closed
his career, he had probably paid more, says
Dr. Southey, for turnpikes, than any other man
in England, for no other man in England
travelled so much. His were no pleasant
journeys, as of summer days; he travelled
through the fens of Lincolnshire when the
waters were out; and over the fells of Northumberland
when they were covered with snow.
Speaking of one tremendous journey, through
<span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>dreadful weather, he says, “Many a rough
journey have I had before; but one like this I
never had, between wind and hail, and rain,
and ice, and snow, and driving sleet, and
piercing cold; but it is past. Those days will
return no more, and are therefore as though
they had never been.</p>

</div>

<p class='c016'>How singular was his visit to Epworth,
where he found the church of his childhood, his
father’s church, the church of his own first
ministrations, closed against him! The minister
of the church was a drunkard; he had
been under great obligations, both to Wesley
himself and to the Wesley family, but he
assailed him with the most offensive brutality;
and when Wesley, denied the pulpit, signified
his intention of simply partaking of the Lord’s
Supper with the parishioners on the following
Sunday, the coarse man sent word, “Tell Mr.
Wesley I shall not give him the Sacrament, for
he is not <i>fit</i>.” It seems to have cut Mr. Wesley
very deeply. “It was fit,” he says, “that
he who repelled me from the table where I had
myself so often distributed the bread of life,
should be one who owed his all in this world to
the tender love my father had shown to his, as
well as personally to himself.” He stayed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>there, however, eight days, and preached every
evening in the churchyard, standing on his
father’s tomb; truly a singular sight, the living
son, the prophet of his age, surely little short
of inspired, preaching from his dead father’s
grave with such pathos and power as we may
well conceive. “I am well assured,” he says,
“I did far more good to my old Lincolnshire
<span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>parishioners by preaching three days on my
father’s tomb than I did by preaching three
years in his pulpit!”</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>As he travelled to and fro, odd mistakes
sometimes happened. Arrived at York, he
went into the church in St. Saviour’s Gate; the
rector, one Mr. Cordeau, had often warned his
congregation against going to hear “that
vagabond Wesley” preach. It was usual in that
day for ministers of the Establishment to wear
the cassock or gown, just as everywhere in
France we see the French abbés. Wesley
had on his gown, like a university man in
a university town. Mr. Cordeau, not knowing
who he was, offered him his pulpit; Wesley
was quite willing, and always ready.
Sermons leaped impromptu from his lips,
and this sermon was an impressive one; at
its close the clerk asked the rector if he knew
who the preacher was. “No.” “Why, sir, it
was that vagabond Wesley!” “Ah, indeed!”
said the astonished clergyman; “well, never
mind, we have had a good sermon.” The
anecdotes of the incidents which waited upon
the preacher in his travels are of every order of
humorous, affecting, and romantic interest; they
are spread over a large variety of volumes, and
even still need to be gathered, framed, and
hung in the light of some effective chronicle.</p>

<p class='c007'>The brilliant passage in which Lord Macaulay
portrays, as with the pencil of a Vandyke,
the features of the great English Puritans, is
worthy of attention. Perhaps, even had the
great essayist attempted the task, he had
scarcely the requisite sympathies to give an
effective portrait or portraits of the early
Methodists; indeed, their characters are different,
as different as a portrait from the pencil of
Denner to one from that of Vandyke, or of
Velasquez; but as Denner is wonderful too, although
<span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>so homely, so the Methodist is a study.
The early Methodist was, perhaps, usually a
very simple, what we should call an ignorant,
man, but he had “the true Light which lighteth
every man that cometh into the world.” He
was not such an one as the early Puritan<a id='r8' /><a href='#f8' class='c012'><b>[8]</b></a> or the
ancient Huguenot, those children of the camp
and of the sword, Nonconformist Templars and
Crusaders, whose theology had trained them
for the battle-field, teaching them to frown defiance
on kings, and to treat with contempt the
proudest nobles, if they were merely unsanctified
men. The Methodist was not such an one
as the stern Ironside of Cromwell; as he lived
in a more cheerful age, so he was the subject of
a more cheerful piety; he was as loyal as he was
lowly. He had been forgotten or neglected by
all the priests and Levites of the land; but a
voice had reached him, and raised him to the
rank of a living, conscious, immortal soul. He
also was one for whom Christ died. A new life
had created new interests in him; and Christianity,
really believed, does ennoble a man—how
can it do otherwise? It gives self-respect
to a man, it shows to him a new purpose and
business in life; moreover, it creates a spirit of
holy cheerfulness and joy; and thus came about
that state of mind which Wesley made subservient
to organisation—the necessity for meetings
<span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>and reciprocations. It has been said that
every church must have some sign or counter-sign,
some symbol to make it popularly successful.
St. Dominic gave to his order the Rosary;
John Wesley gave to his Society the Ticket.
There were no chapels, or but few, and none to
open their doors to these strange new pilgrims
to the celestial city. We have seen that the
churches were closed against them. Lord
Macaulay says, had John Wesley risen in the
Church of Rome, she would have thrown her
arms round him, only regarding him as the
founder of a new order, with certain peculiarities
calculated to increase and to extend her
empire, and in due time have given to him the
honours of canonisation.</p>

</div>

<p class='c007'>The English clergy as a body gathered up
their garments and shrunk from all contact
with the Methodists as from a pestilence. What
could be done? Something must be done to
prevent them from falling back into the world.
Piety needs habit, and must become habitual to
be safe, even as the fine-twined linen of the
veil, and the ark of the covenant, and the
cherubim shadowing the mercy-seat, were shut
in and all their glory defended by the rude coverings
of badger-skins. John Wesley knew that
the safety of the converted would be in frequent
meetings for singing and prayer and conversation.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>Reciprocation is the soul of Methodism;
so they assembled in each others’
houses, in rude and lonely but convenient
rooms, by farm-house ingles, in lone hamlets.
Thus was created a homely piety, often rugged
enough, no doubt, but full of beautiful and
pathetic instincts. So grew what came to be
called band-meetings, class-meetings, love-feasts,
and all the innumerable means by which
the Methodist Society worked, until it became
like a wheel within a wheel; simple enough,
however, in the days to which we are referring.
“Look to the Lord, and faithfully attend all
the means of grace appointed in the Society.”
Such was, practically, the whole of Methodism.
So that famous old lady, whose bright example
has so often been held up on Methodist platforms,
when called upon to state the items of
her creed, did so very sufficiently when she
summed it up in the four particulars of “repentance
towards God; faith in the Lord Jesus
Christ; a penny a week; and a shilling a
quarter.” Wesley seems to have summed the
Methodist creed more simply still: “Belief in
the Lord Jesus Christ, and an earnest desire to
flee from the wrath to come.” This was his
condition of Church fellowship. When the
faith became more consciously objective, it too
was seized by the passionate instinct, the desire t
<span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>o save souls. This drove the early Methodists
out on great occasions to call vast multitudes
together on heaths, on moors. Perhaps—but
this was at a later time—some country
gentleman threw open his old hall to the
preachers; though the more aristocratic phase
of the Methodist movement fell into the Calvinistic
rather than into the Wesleyan ranks,
and subsided into the organisation of the
Countess of Huntingdon, which was, in fact, a
kind of Free Church of England. The followers
of Wesley sought the sequestration of
nature, or in cities and towns they took to the
streets or the broad ways and outlying fields.
In some neighbourhoods a little room was built,
containing the germ of what in a few years became
a large Wesleyan Society. The burden
of all these meetings, and all their intercourse,
whether in speech or song, was the sweetness
and fulness of Jesus. They had intense faith in
the love of God shed abroad in the heart; and
their great interest was in souls on the brink of
perdition. They knew little of spiritual difficulties
or speculative despair; their conflict was
with the world, the flesh, and the devil; and in
this person, whose features have lately become
somewhat dim, and who has wrapped himself
in a new cloak of darkness, they did really believe.
Wesley dealt with sin as sin, and with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>souls as souls; he and his band of preachers had
little regard to proprieties, and it was not a
polished time; so, ungraceful and undignified,
the face weary, and the hand heavy with toil,
they seemed out of breath pursuing souls. The
strength of all these men was that they had a
definite creed, and they sought to guard it by a
definite Church life. The early Methodist had
also cultivated the mighty instinct of prayer,
about which he had no philosophy, but believing
that God heard him, he quite simply indulged
in it as a passion, and in this to him
there was at once a meaning and a joy. We
are not under the necessity of vindicating
every phase of the great movement, we are
simply writing down some particulars of its
history, and how it was that it grew and prevailed.
God’s ministry goes on by various
means, ordinary and extraordinary; that is the
difference between rivers and rains, between
dews and lightnings.</p>

<p class='c007'>A very interesting chapter, perhaps a volume,
might be compiled from the old records of the
mere anecdotes—the very humours—of the persecution
attending on the Revival. Thus, in
Cornwall, Edward Greenfield, a tanner, with a
wife and seven children, was arrested under a
warrant granted by Dr. Borlase, the eminent
antiquary, who was, however, a bitter foe to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>Methodism. It was inquired what was the
objection to Greenfield, a peaceable, inoffensive
man; and the answer was, “The man is well
enough, but the gentlemen round about can’t
bear his impudence; why, he says he knows
his sins are forgiven!” The story is well
known how, in one place, a whole waggon-load
of Methodists were taken before the magistrates;
but when the question was asked in
court what they had done, a profound silence
fell over the assembly, for no one was prepared
with a charge against them, till somebody
exclaimed, “They pretended to be
better than other people, and prayed from
morning till night!” And another voice
shouted out, “And they’ve <i>convarted</i> my wife;
till she went among they, she had a tongue of
her own, and now she’s as quiet as a lamb!”
“Take them all back, take them all back,” said
the sensible magistrate, “and let them convert
all the scolds in the town!”</p>

<p class='c007'>There is a spot in Cornwall which may be
said to be consecrated and set apart to the
memory of Wesley; it is in the immediate
neighbourhood of Redruth, a wild, bare, rugged-looking
region now, very suggestive of its
savage aspect upwards of a hundred years
since. The spot to which we refer is the
Gwennap Pit; it is a wild amphitheatre, cut out
<span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>among the hills, capable of holding about thirty
thousand persons. Its natural walls slant upwards,
and the place has altogether wonderful
properties for the carrying the human voice.
Wesley began to preach in this spot in 1762.
When he first visited Cornwall, the savage
mobs of what used to be called “West Barbary,”
howled and roared upon him like lions or
wild beasts; in his later years of visitation, no
emperor or sovereign prince could have been
received with more reverence and affection. The
streets were lined and the windows of the
houses thronged with gazing crowds, to see
him as he walked along; and no wonder, for
Cornwall was one of the chief territories of that
singular ecclesiastical kingdom of which he
was the founder. When he first went into
Cornwall, it was really a region of savage
irreligion and heathenism. The reader of his
life often finds, usually about once a year, the
visit to Gwennap Pit recorded: he preached his
first sermon there, as we have said, in 1762; at
the age of eighty-six he preached his last in
1789. There, from time to time, they poured
in from all the country round to see and to
listen to the words of this truly reverend
father.</p>

</div>

<p class='c007'>The traditions of Methodism have few more
imposing scenes. Gwennap Pit was, perhaps,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>Wesley’s most famous cathedral; a magnificent
church, if we may apply that term to a building
of nature, among the wild moors; it was
thronged by hushed and devout worshippers.
Until Wesley went among these people, the
whole immense population might have said, “No
man cared for our souls;” now they poured in to
see him there: wild miners from the immediate
neighbourhood, fishermen from the coast, men
who until their conversion had pursued the
wrecker’s remorseless and criminal career,
smugglers, more quiet men and their families
less savage, but not less ignorant, from their
shieling, or lowly farmstead on the distant
heath. A strange throng, if we think of it,
men who had never used God’s name except in
an oath, and who had never breathed a prayer
except for the special providence of a shipwreck,
and who with wicked barbarity had kindled
their delusive lights along the coasts, to fascinate
unfortunate ships to the cruel cliffs! But
a Divine power had passed over them, and they
were changed, with their families; and hither
they came to gladden the heart of the old
patriarch in the wild glen—a strange spot, and
not unbeautiful, roofed over by the blue heavens.
Amidst the broom, the twittering birds,
the heath flower, and the scantling of trees,
amidst the venerable rocks, it must have been
<span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>wonderful to hear the thirty thousand voices
welling up, and singing Wesley’s words:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>

      <div class='line'>“Suffice that for the season past,</div>

Revival.</p>

  <h2 id='ch06' class='c004'>CHAPTER VI<br /> <br /><span class='small'>THE SINGERS OF THE REVIVAL.</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c006'>Chief of all the auxiliary circumstances
which aided the Great Revival, beyond a question,
was this: that it taught the people of
England, for the first time, the real power of
sacred song. That man in the north of England
who, when taken, by a companion who
had been converted, to a great Methodist
preaching, and being asked at the close of the
service how he had enjoyed it, replied, “Weel,
I didna care sae mich aboot the preaching, but,
eh, man! yon ballants were grand,” was no
doubt a representative character. And the
great and subduing power of large bodies of
people, moved as with one heart and one voice,
must have greatly aided to produce those
effects which we are attempting to realise.
All great national movements have acknowledged
and used the power of song. For man
is a born singer, and if he cannot sing himself
he likes to feel the power of those who can. It
has been so in political movements: there were
the songs of the Roundheads and the Cavaliers.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>And the greatest religious movements through
all the Christian ages have acknowledged the
power of sacred song, even from the days of
the apostles, and from the time of St. Ambrose
in Milan. Luther soon found that he must
teach the people to sing. That is a pleasant
little story, how once, as he was sitting at his
window, he heard a blind beggar sing. It was
something about the grace of God, and Luther
says the strain brought tears into his eyes.
Then, he says, the thought suddenly flashed
into his mind, “If I could only make gospel
songs which people could sing, and which
would spread themselves up and down the
cities!” He directly set to work upon this
inspiration, and let fly song after song, each
like a lark mounting towards heaven’s gate, full
of New Testament music. “He took care,”
says one writer, in mentioning the incident,
“that each song should have some rememberable
word or refrain; such as ‘Jesus,’ ‘Believe
and be saved,’ ‘Come unto Me,’ ‘Gospel,’
‘Grace,’ ‘Worthy is the Lamb,’ and so on.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Until Watts and Doddridge appeared, England
had no popular sacred melodies. Amongst
the works of the poets, such as Sir Philip Sidney,
Milton, Sandys, George Herbert, and
others, a few were scattered up and down; but
they mostly lacked the subtle element which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>constitutes a hymn. For, just as a man may be
a great poet, and utterly fail in the power
to write a good song, so a man may be a
great sacred poet, and yet miss the faculty
which makes the hymn-writer. It is singular,
it is almost indefinable. The subtle
something which catches the essential elements
of a great human experience, and gives it
lyrical expression, takes that which other men
put into creeds, sermons, theological essays,
and sets it flying, as we just now said, like
“the lark to heaven’s gate.” It ought never to
be forgotten that Watts was, in fact, the
creator of the English hymn. He wrote many
lines which good taste can in no case approve;
but here again the old proverb holds true,
“The house that is building does not look like
the house that is built.” And the great number
of following writers, while they have felt
the inspiration he gave to the Church, have
moulded their lines by a more fastidious taste,
which, if it has sometimes improved the metre
or the sentiment, has possibly diminished in
the strength. We will venture to say that even
now there is a greater average of majesty of
thought and expression in Watts’s hymns than
in any other of our great hymn-writers;
although, in some cases, we find here and there
a piece which may equal, and some one or two
<span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>which are said to surpass, the flights of the
sweet singer of Stoke Newington. But the
hymns of Watts, as a whole, were not so well
fitted to a great and popular revival, to the
expression of a tumultuous and passionate experience,
as some we shall notice. They were,
as a whole, especially wanting in the social
element, and the finest of them sound like
notes from the harp of some solitary angel.
One cannot give to them the designation which
the Wesleys gave to large sections of their
hymns, “suitable for experience meetings.”
Praise rather than experience is the characteristic
of Watts, although there are noble
exceptions. Our readers will perhaps remember
a well-known and pleasing instance in a
letter from Doddridge to his aged friend.
Doddridge had been preaching on a summer
evening in some plain old village chapel in
Northamptonshire, when at the close of the
service was “given out,” as we say, that hymn
commencing:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Give me the wings of faith to rise.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c018'>We can suppose the melody to which it was
sung to have been very rude; but it was, perhaps,
new to the people, and the preacher was
affected as he saw how, over the congregation,
the people were singing earnestly, and melted
<span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>to tears while they sang; and at the close of
the service many old people gathered round
Doddridge, their hearts all alive with the hymn,
and they wished it were possible, only for once,
to look upon the face of the dear old Dr. Watts.
Doddridge was so pleased that he thought his
old friend would be pleased also, and so he
wrote the account of the little incident in a
letter to him. In many other parts of the
country, no doubt, the people were waiting and
wishful for popular sacred harmonies. And
when the Great Revival came, and congregations
met by thousands, and multitudes who
had been accustomed to song, thoughtless,
foolish, very often sinful and licentious, still
needed to sing (for song and human nature are
inseparable, apparently, so far as we know anything
about it, in the next world as well as in
this), it was necessary that, as they had been
“brought up out of the horrible pit and miry
clay,” “a new song of praise” should be put in
the mouth. John Wesley had heard much of
Moravian singing. He took Count Zinzendorf’s
hymns, translated them, and immensely improved
them; he was the first who introduced
into our psalmody the noble words of Paul
Gerhardt. Some of the finest of all the hymns
in the Wesleyan collection are these translations.
Watts was unsparingly used. Wesley’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>first effort to meet this necessity of the Revival
was the publication of his collection in 1739.<a id='r9' /><a href='#f9' class='c012'><b>[9]</b></a>
And thus, most likely without knowing the
anecdote of Luther we have quoted above,
Wesley and his coadjutors did exactly what
the Reformer had done. They gave effect to the
Revival by the ordinance of song, and preached
the Gospel in sweet words, and often recurring
Gospel refrains.</p>

<div class='footnote c013' id='f9'>
<p class='c014'><span class='label'><a href='#r9'>9</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>See <a href='#p-114'>Appendix</a>.</p>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The remark is true that there was no art, no
splendid form of worship or ritual; early Methodism
and the entire evangelic movement were
as free from all this as Clairvaux in the Valley of
Wormwood, when Bernard ministered there
with all his monks around him, or as Cluny
when Bernard de Morlaix chanted his “Jerusalem
the Golden.” Like all great religious
movements which have shaken men’s souls, this
was purely spiritual, or if it had a secular expression
it was not artificial. Loud amens resounded
as the preacher spoke or prayed, and
then the hearty gushes of, perhaps, not melodious
song united all hearts in some litany or
Te Deum in new-born verse from some of the
singers of the last revival. Amongst infuriated
mobs, we read how Wesley found a retreat in
song, and overpowered the multitude with what
we, perhaps, should not regard melody. Thus,
when at Bengeworth in 1740, where Wesley
<span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>was set upon by a crowd, and it was proposed
by one that they should take him away and
duck him, he broke out into singing with his
redoubted friend, Thomas Maxfield. He allowed
them to carry him whither they would;
at the bridge end of the street the mob retreated
and left him; but he took his stand on the
bridge, and striking up—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Angel of God, whate’er betide,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Thy summons I obey,”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c018'>preached a useful and effective sermon to hundreds
who remained to listen, from the text,
“If God be for us, who can be against us?”</p>
<p class='c007'>But the contributions of Watts and Wesley
are so well known that it is more important to
notice here that as the Revival moved on, very
soon other remarkable lyrists appeared to contribute,
if few, yet really effective words. Of
these none is more remarkable than the mighty
cobbler, Thomas Olivers, a “sturdy Welshman,”
as Southey calls him. He is not to be
confounded with John Oliver, also one of the
notabilities of the Revival. Thomas was really
an astonishing trophy of the movement; before
his conversion he was a thoroughly bad fellow,
a kind of wandering reprobate, an idle, dissipated
man. He fell beneath the power of
Whitefield, whom he heard preach from the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>text, “Is not this a brand plucked out of the
fire?” He had made comic songs about Whitefield,
and sung them with applause in tap-rooms.
As Whitefield came in his way, he went
with the purpose of obtaining fresh fuel for his
ridicule. The heart of the man was completely
broken, and he felt so much compunction for
what he had done against the man for whom
he now felt so deep a reverence and awe, that
he used to follow him in the streets, and though
he did not speak to him, he says he could
scarcely refrain from kissing the prints of his
footsteps. And now, he says, at the beginning
of his new life, what we can well believe
of an imagination so intense and strong, “I saw
God in everything: the heavens, the earth and
all therein showed me something of Him; yea,
even from a drop of water, a blade of grass, or
a grain of sand, I received instruction.” He was
about seriously to enter into a settled and respectable
way of business when John Wesley
heard of him; and although he was converted
under Whitefield, Wesley persuaded him to
yield himself to his direction for the work of
preaching as one of his itinerant band, and sent
him into Cornwall—just the man we should
think for Cornwall, fiery and imaginative: off
he went, in 1753. He was born in 1725. He
testifies that he was “unable to buy a horse,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>so, with my boots on my legs, my great-coat
on my back, and my bag with my books and
linen across my shoulders, I set out for Cornwall
on foot.” Henceforth there were forty-six
years on earth before him, during which he witnessed
a magnificent confession before many
witnesses. He became one of the foremost
controversialists when dissensions arose among
the men of the Revival. He acquired a knowledge
of the languages, especially of Hebrew,
and was a great reader. Wesley appointed
him as his editor and general proofreader; but
he could never be taught to punctuate properly,
and the punctilious Wesley could not tolerate
his inaccuracies as they slipped through the
proof, so he did not retain this post long. But
Wesley loved him, and in 1799 he descended
into Wesley’s own tomb, and his remains lie
there, in the cemetery of the City Road Chapel.
He wrote more prose than poetry; but, like
St. Ambrose, he is made immortal by a single
hymn. He is the author of one of the most
majestic hymns in all hymnology. Byron and
Scott wrote Hebrew melodies, but they will
not bear comparison with this one. While in
London upon one occasion, he went into the
Jewish synagogue, and he heard sung there by
a rabbi, Dr. Leoni, an old air, a melody which
so enchanted him and fixed itself in his memory,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>that he went home, and instantly produced
what he called “a hymn to the God of Abraham,”
arranged to the air he had heard. And
thus we possess that which we so frequently
sing,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“The God of Abraham praise!”<a id='r10' /><a href='#f10' class='c012'><b>[10]</b></a></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c018'>It is principally known by its first four verses;
there are twelve. “There is not,” says James
Montgomery, “in our language a lyric of more
majestic style, more elevated thought, or more
glorious imagery; *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* like a stately pile of
architecture, severe and simple in design; it
strikes less on the first view than after deliberate
examination, *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* the mind itself grows
greater in contemplating it;” and he continues,
“On account of the peculiarity of the measure,
none but a person of equal musical and poetical
taste could have produced the harmony perceptible
in the verse.” There will, perhaps,
always be a doubt whether Olivers was the
author of the hymn,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Lo! He comes with clouds descending.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c018'>If Charles Wesley were the author, he undoubtedly
derived the inspiration of the piece from
Olivers’ hymn, “The Last Judgment:”<a id='r11' /><a href='#f11' class='c012'><b>[11]</b></a> it is in
the same metre, and probably Wesley took the
thought and the metre, and adapted it to popular
service. What is undoubted is that Olivers,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>who is the author of the metre, is also the author
of the fine old tune “Helmsley,” to which
the hymn was usually sung until quite recent
times; the tune was originally called “Olivers.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c007'>It is but a natural step from Thomas Olivers
to his great antagonist, Augustus Toplady; he
also is made immortal by a hymn. He wrote
many fine ones, full of melody, pathos, and
affecting imagery. Toplady, as all our readers
know, was a clergyman, the Vicar of Broad
Hembury, in Devonshire. He took the strong
Calvinistic side in the controversies which
arose in the course of the Great Revival;
Olivers took the strong Arminian side. They
were not very civil to each other; and the
scholarly clergyman no doubt felt his dignity
somewhat hurt by the rugged contact with the
cobbler; but the quarrels are forgotten now,
and there is scarcely a hymn-book in which the
hymn of Olivers is not found within a few pages
of</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Rock of Ages, cleft for me!”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c016'>To this hymn has been given almost universally
the palm as the finest hymn in our
language. Where there are so many, at once
deeply expressive in experience, and subdued
and elevated in feeling, we perhaps may be forgiven
if we hesitate before praise so eminently
high.  Mr. Gladstone’s translation into the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>Latin, in the estimation of eminent scholars,
even carries a more thrilling and penetrative
awe.<a id='r12' /><a href='#f12' class='c012'><b>[12]</b></a> But Toplady wrote many other hymns
quite equal in pathos and poetic merit. The
characteristic of “Rock of Ages” is its depth of
penitential devotion. A volume might be written
on the history of this expressive hymn. Innumerable
are the multitudes whom these words
have sustained when dying; they were among
the last which lingered on the lips of Prince
Albert as he was passing away; and to how
many, through every variety of social distinction,
have they been at once the creed and consolation!
It is by his hymns that Toplady will
be chiefly remembered. For years he was hovering
along on the borders of the grave, slowly
dying of consumption; and he died in 1778, in
the thirty-eighth year of his age. It was his
especial wish that he should be buried with
more than quiet, that no announcement should
be made of the funeral, and that there should
be no especial service at his grave: it testifies,
however, to the high regard in which he was
held that thousands followed him to his burial
in Tottenham Court Road Chapel; and when
we know that his dear friend Rowland Hill
conducted the service, we can scarcely be surprised,
or offended, that he broke through the
injunctions of his friend, and addressed the multitude
<span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>in affectionate commemoration of the
sweet singer.</p>

<p><span class='small'>AUGUSTUS TOPLADY.</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Toplady we should regard as the chief singer
of the Revival, after Charles Wesley, although
entirely of another order; not so social as meditative,
and reminding us, in many of his pieces,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>of the characteristics we have attributed to
Watts. His midnight hymn is a piece of uncommon
sublimity; portions of it seem almost
unfit for congregational singing; but for inward
plaintive meditation, for reading in the evening
family prayer, when the hushed stillness of night
is over the household, and the pilgrim of life
is about to commit himself to the unconsciousness
of sleep, the verses seem tenderly suggestive:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Thy ministering spirits descend,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>And watch while Thy saints are asleep;</div>
      <div class='line in1'>By day and by night they attend,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>The heirs of salvation to keep.</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Bright seraphs despatched from the throne,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Fly swift to their stations assigned;</div>
      <div class='line in1'>And angels elect are sent down</div>
      <div class='line in2'>To guard the elect of mankind.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Their worship no interval knows;</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Their fervour is still on the wing;</div>
      <div class='line in1'>And, while they protect my repose,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>They chant to the praise of my King.</div>
      <div class='line in1'>I, too, at the season ordained,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Their chorus forever shall join,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>And love and adore without end,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Their gracious Creator and mine.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c016'>We have noticed in a previous chapter that
when Whitefield separated himself from Wesley,
the Revival took two distinctly different
routes. We only refer to this again for the
purpose of remarking that as Toplady was intensely
<span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>Calvinistic in his method of Divine
grace, so his hymns, also, reflect in all its fulness
that creed; yet they are full of tenderness,
and well calculated frequently to arouse dormant
devotion. “Your harps, ye trembling
saints;” “Emptied of earth I fain would be;”
“When languor and disease invade;” “Jesus,
immutably the same;” “A debtor to mercy
alone,” and many another, leave nothing to be
desired either on the score of devotion, poetry,
or melody.</p>

<p class='c007'>In a far humbler sphere, but representing the
same faith and fervour as Toplady, and also
carried away young, was Cennick. In an article
in the <i>Christian Remembrancer</i>, on English
hymnology, written very much for the purpose
of throwing contempt on all the hymn-writers
of the Revival, Cennick is spoken of as “a low
and violent person; his hymns peculiarly offensive,
both as to matter and manner.” Some exceptions
are made by the reviewer for “Children
of the Heavenly King.” We may presume,
therefore, that to this writer, “Thou dear Redeemer,
dying Lamb,” is one of the “peculiarly
offensive.” This is not wonderful, when in the
next page we read that “the hymns of Newton
are the very essence of doggerel.” This sounds
rather strange, as a verdict, to those who have
felt the particular charm of that much-loved
<span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>hymn, “How sweet the name of Jesus sounds!”
It is not without a purpose that we refer to
this paper in the <i>Christian Remembrancer</i>—evidently
by a very scholarly hand—because its
whole tone shows how the sacred song of the
Revival would be likely to be regarded by
those who had no sympathy with its evangelical
teaching. The writer, for instance, speaking
of Wesley’s hymns, doubts whether any of
them could possibly be included by any chance
in English hymnology! “Jesus, lover of my
soul,” is said, “in some <i>small</i> degree to approximate
to the model of a Church hymn!”
Of the Countess of Huntingdon’s hymn-book,
the writer says, “We shall certainly not notice
the raving profanity!” It is not necessary further
either to sadden or to irritate the reader
by similar expressions; but the entire paper,
and the criticisms we have cited, will show
what was likely to be the effect of the hymns
of the Revival on many similar minds of that
time. In fact, the joy of the Revival work
arose from this, that no person, no priest, nor
Church usage, was needed to interpose between
the soul and the Saviour. Faith in
Christ, and His immediate, personal presence
with the soul seeking Him by faith, as it was
the burden of the best of the sermons, so it
was, also, of all the great hymns.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>The origin and the authors of several eminent
hymns are certainly obscure. To Edward
Perronet must be assigned the authorship of
the fine coronation anthem of the Lamb that
was slain: “All hail the power of Jesus’ name!”</p>

<p class='c007'>Another, which has become a universal favourite,
is “Beyond the glittering starry globe.”
This is a noble and inspiring hymn; only a few
verses are usually quoted in our hymn-books.
Lord Selborne divides its authorship between
Fanch and Turner. We have seen it attributed
to Olivers; this is certainly a mistake. The
<i>Quarterly Review</i>, in a very able paper on
hymnology, reproducing an old legend concerning
it, traces it to two brothers in a
humble situation in life, one an itinerant
preacher, the other a porter. The preacher desired
the porter to carry a letter for him. “I
can’t go,” said the porter, “I am writing a
hymn.” “You write a hymn, indeed! Nonsense!
you go with the letter, and I will finish
the hymn.” He went, and returned, but the
hymn was unfinished. The preacher had taken
it up at the third verse, and his muse had forsaken
him at the eighth. “Give me the pen,”
said the porter, and he wrote off,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“They brought His chariot from above,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>To bear Him to His throne;</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Clapped their triumphant wings, and cried,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>‘The glorious work is done!’”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c016'><span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>Unfortunately the author of the paper in the
<i>Quarterly Review</i> appears never to have seen
the hymn in its entirety. The verse he cites is
not the eighth, but the twenty-second, and it
has been mutilated almost wherever quoted;
the verse itself is part of an apostrophe to the
angels, recalling their ministrations round our
Lord:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Tended His chariot up the sky,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>And bore Him to His throne;</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Then swept your golden harps and cried,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>‘The glorious work is done!’”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c016'>Whoever wrote the hymn had the imagination
of a poet, the fine pathos of a believer, and
a strong lyrical power of expression.</p>

<p class='c007'>Anecdotes of the origin of many of our great
hymns of this period are as interesting as they
are almost innumerable; those of which we are
speaking are hymns of the Revival—to speak
concisely—perhaps commenced with the Wesleys,
and closed with Cowper and Newton. It
must not be supposed that there were no
singers save those whose verses found their
way into the Wesleyan or other great collections
of hymns; there were James Grant,
Joseph Griggs, especially notable, Miss Steele,
the author of a great number of hymns of
universal acceptance in all our churches, and
which are more like those of Doddridge than
<span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>any other since his day. Then there was John
Stocker,—but we would particularly notice Job
Hupton, the author of a hymn which has never
been included in any hymn-book except <i>Our
Hymn Book</i>, edited by the author of this volume,
but which is scarcely inferior to “Beyond the
glittering starry sky.”</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Come, ye saints, and raise an anthem,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Cleave the skies with shouts of praise,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Sing to Him who found a ransom,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Ancient of eternal days.</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Bring your harps, and bring your odours,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Sweep the string and pour the lay;</div>
      <div class='line in1'>View His works! behold His wonders!</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Let hosannas crown the day!”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c018'>The hymn is far too long for quotation. Job
Hupton was a Baptist minister in the neighbourhood
of Beccles, where he died in 1849, in
the eighty-eighth year of his age, and the
sixty-fifth of his ministry.</p>
<p class='c007'>Thus there was set free throughout the country
a spirit of sacred song which was new to
the experience of the nation: it was boldly
evangelical; it was devoted, not to the eulogy
of Church forms and days; there was not a
syllable of Mariolatry; but praise to Christ,
earnest meditation upon the state of man
without His work, and the blessedness of the
soul which had risen to the saving apprehension
of it. This forms the whole substance of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>the Divine melody. It has seemed to some that
the most perfect hymn in the English language
is, “Jesus! lover of my soul.” Sentiments
may differ, arising from modifications of experience,
but that hymn undoubtedly is the very
essence of all the hymns which were sung in
the days of the Great Revival. For the first
time there was given to Christian experience that
which met it at every turn. Watts found such
a choir, and such an audience for his devotions,
as he had never known in his life; and “Charles
Wesley,” says Isaac Taylor, “has been drawing
thousands in his wake and onward, from earth
to heaven.” The hymns met and united all
companies and all societies. The bridal party
returned from church, singing,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“We kindly help each other,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Till all shall wear the starry crown.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c018'>If they gathered round the grave, they sang;—and
what a variety of glorious funereal hymns
they had! But that was a great favourite:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“There all the ship’s company meet,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Who sailed with their Saviour beneath;</div>
      <div class='line in1'>With shoutings each other they greet,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>And triumph o’er sorrow and death.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c018'>Few separations took place without that song,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Blest be the dear uniting love,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>That will not let us part.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c018'><span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>While others became such favourites that even
almost every service had to be hallowed by
them; such as,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Jesus! the name high over all,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>In hell, or earth, or sky;”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c018'>while an equal favourite almost, was,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Oh, for a thousand tongues to sing</div>
      <div class='line in1'>My great Redeemer’s praise!”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c018'>They must soon have become very well known,
for so early as 1748, when a sad cluster of convicts,
horse-stealers, highway robbers, burglars, smugglers,
and thieves, were led forth to execution,
the turnkey of the prison said he had never seen
such people before. The Methodists had been
among them; they had all yielded themselves
to the power of “the truth as it is in Jesus,”
and on their way to Tyburn they all sang
together,</p>
<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Lamb of God! whose bleeding love</div>
      <div class='line in2'>We now recall to mind,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Send the answer from above,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>And let us mercy find;</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Think on us, who think of Thee,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>And every struggling soul release;</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Oh! remember Calvary,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>And let us go in peace!”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c016'>The hymns found their way to sick beds.
The old Earl of Derby, the grandfather of the
present peer, was dying at Knowsley. He had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>for his housekeeper there a Mrs. Brass, a good
and faithful Methodist; the old Earl was fond of
talking with her upon religious matters, and
one day she read to him the well-known hymn,
“All ye that pass by, to Jesus draw nigh.”
When she came to the lines,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“The Lord in the day of His anger did lay</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Our sins on the Lamb, and he bore them away,”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c018'>the Earl looked up and said, “Stop! don’t
you think, Mrs. Brass, that ought to be, ‘The
Lord in the day of his <i>mercy</i> did lay’?”</p>
<p class='c007'>The old lady did not admit the validity of
his lordship’s theology; but it very abundantly
showed that his experience had passed through
the verse, and reached to the true meaning of
the hymn. An old blind woman was hearing
Peter McOwan preach. He quoted these lines:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“The Lord pours eyesight on the blind;</div>
      <div class='line in1'>The Lord supports the fainting mind.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c018'>The poor old woman was not happy until she
met the preacher, and she said, “But are there
really such sweet verses? Are you sure the
book contains such a hymn?” and he read the
whole to her. It is one by Watts:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“I’ll praise my Maker while I’ve breath.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c016'>Innumerable are the anecdotes of these
hymns; they inaugurated really the rise of English
<span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>hymnology; and it is not too much to say
that, as compared with them, many more recent
hymns are as tinsel compared with gold.
A writer truly says: “They sob, they swell,
they meet the spirit in its most hushed and
plaintive mood. They roll and bear it aloft, in
its most inspired and prophetic moods, as on
the surge of more than a mighty organ swell;
among the mines and quarries, and wild moors
of Cornwall, among the factories of Lancashire
and Yorkshire, in chambers of death, in the
most joyous assemblages of the household,
they have relieved the hard lot, and sweetened
the pleasant one; and even in other lands soldiers
and sailors, slaves and prisoners, have recited
with what joy these words have entered
into their life.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Thus the great hymns of this period grew
and became a religious power in the land,
strangely contradicting a verdict which Cardinal
Wiseman pronounced some years since,
that “all Protestant devotion is dead.” While
we give all honour to the fine hymns of Denmark
and Germany, many of the best of which
were translated with the movement, it may,
with no exaggeration, be said that the hymnology
of England in the eighteenth century is
the finest and most complete which the history
of the Church has known.</p>

  <h2 id='ch07' class='c004'>CHAPTER VII<br /> <br /><span class='small'>LAY PREACHING AND LAY PREACHERS.</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c006'>There came with the work of the Revival a
practice, without which it is more than questionable
if it would have obtained such a rapid
and abiding hold upon the various populations
and districts of the country; this was lay
preaching. The designation must have a more
inclusive interpretation than we generally apply
to it; we must understand by it rather the
work of those men who, in contradistinction
to the great leaders of the Revival—men of
scholarship, of universities, and of education—possessed
none of these qualifications, or but in
a more slight and undisciplined degree. They
were converted men, modified by various temperaments;
they one and all possessed an ardent
zeal; but, in many instances, we shall
find that they were as much devoted to the
work of the ministry as those who had received
a regular ordination. It is singular that prejudices
so strong should exist against lay preaching
and preachers, for the practice has surely
received the sanction of the most ancient
<span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>usages of the Church, as even Dr. Southey admits,
in his notes to the <i>Life of Wesley</i>. Thus,
in the history of the Church, this phenomenon
could scarcely be regarded as new. Orders of
preaching friars; “hedge-preachers,” “black,
white, and grey,” with all their company; disciples
of Francis, Dominic, or Ignatius, had
spread over Europe during the dark and
mediæval ages. Although this rousing element
of Church life had not found much expression
in the churches of the Reformation, yet with
the impulse of the new Revival, up started
these men by multitudes. The reason of this
was very simple. There is a well-known little
anecdote of some town missionary standing up
in a broad highway preaching to a multitude.
He was arrested by a Roman Catholic priest,
who asked him from the edge of the crowd by
what authority he dared to stand there? and
who had given him the right to preach? The
man had his New Testament in his hand; he
rapidly turned to the last chapter of it, and
said, “I find it written here, ‘Let him that
heareth say, Come!’ I have heard, and I would
say Come!” The anecdote represents sufficiently
the rise and progress of lay preaching
in the Revival. There first appeared, naturally,
a simple set of men, who, in their different
spheres, would, perhaps, lead and direct a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>prayer-meeting, and round it with some pious
and gentle exhortation. We have already
pointed out the necessity soon felt for frequent
and reciprocative services; these were not the
lay preachers to whom we refer; but in this
fraternal form of Church fellowship, the lay
preacher had his origin.</p>

<p class='c007'>Wesley imposed restrictions upon his helpers
which he soon found himself compelled to renounce.
John Wesley was a strong adherent
to the idea of Church order. The first lay
preacher in his communion who leapt over
the traces was Thomas Maxfield. It was at
the Foundry in Moor Fields. Wesley was in
Bristol, and the intelligence was conveyed to
him. He appears to have regarded it as a serious
and dangerous innovation. The good
Susannah Wesley, his mother—now past threescore
years and ten—infirm and feeble, was yet
living in the Chapel House of the Foundry.
To her John hurried on his arrival in London;
and after his affectionate salutations and inquiries,
he expressed such a manifest dissatisfaction
and anxiety that she inquired the cause.
With some indignation and unusual abruptness,
he said, “Thomas Maxfield has turned preacher,
I find;” and then the wise and saintly woman
gave him her advice. She reminded him that,
from her prejudices against lay preaching he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>could not suspect her of favouring anything of
the kind; “but take care,” she said, “what you
do respecting that young man, for he is as surely
called of God to preach as you are.” She advised
her son to hear Maxfield for himself. He
did so, and at once buried all his prejudices.
He exclaimed after the sermon, “It is the
Lord, let Him do what seemeth Him good!”
and Thomas Maxfield became the first of a
host who spread all over the country.</p>

<p class='c007'>It may be supposed that the Countess of
Huntingdon very naturally shared all Wesley’s
prejudices against lay preaching; but she heard
Maxfield preach, and she wrote of him, “God
has raised one from the stones to sit among
the princes of the people. He is my astonishment;
how is God’s power shown in weakness!”
and she soon set herself to the work of supplying
an order of men, of whom Maxfield was the
first to lead the way. By-and-by came another
innovation: the lay evangelists at first never
went into the pulpit, but spoke from among
the people, or from the desk. The first who
broke through this usage was Thomas Walsh;
we will say more of him presently. He was a
man of deep humility, and his life reveals entire
and extraordinary consecration; but he believed
himself to be an ambassador for Christ,
and he walked directly up into the pulpit, never
<span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>questioning, but quite disregarding the usual
custom. The majesty of his manner, his solemn,
impressive, and commanding eloquence, forbade
all remark; and henceforth all the lay
preachers followed his example. There arose
a band of extraordinary men. Let the reader
refer to the chronicles of their lives, and the
effects of their labours, and he will not suppose
that he has seen anything in our day at all
approaching to what they were.</p>

<p class='c007'>Local preachers have now long been part of
the great organisation of Methodism. But in
the period to which we refer, it must be
remembered that the pen had not commenced
the exercise of its more popular influence.
There were few authors, few journalists, very
few really popular books; these men, then, with
their various gifts of elevated holiness, broad and
rugged humour, or glowing imagination, went
to and fro among the people, rousing and
instructing the dormant mind of the country.
Then it was Wesley’s great aim to sustain
interest by variety. Wesley himself said that
he believed he should preach himself and his
congregation asleep if he were to confine his
ministrations to one pulpit for twelve months.
We would take the liberty to say in reference
to this, that it would depend upon whether he
kept his own mind fresh and wakeful during
<span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>the time. He writes, however: “We have
found by long and constant experience, that a
frequent change of teachers is best; this
preacher has one talent, that another. No one
whom I ever knew has all the talents which
are needful for beginning, continuing, and perfecting
the work in a whole congregation;
neither,” he adds, “can he find matter for
preaching morning and evening, nor will the
people come to hear him; hence he grows cold,
and so do the people; whereas if he never stays
more than a fortnight together in one place, he
may find matter enough, and the people will
gladly hear him.”</p>

<p class='c007'>This certainly gives an idea but of a plain
order of services; and, no doubt, some of Wesley’s
preachers were of the plainest. There
was Michael Fenwick, of whom Wesley says,
“he was just made to travel with me—an
excellent groom, <i>valet de chambre</i>, nurse, and,
upon occasion, a tolerable preacher.” This
good man was one day vain enough to complain
to Wesley, that although he was constantly
travelling with him, his name was never
inserted in Wesley’s published <i>Journals</i>. In
the next number he found himself immortalised
with his master there. “I left Epworth,”
writes Wesley, “with great satisfaction, and
about one, preached at Clayworth. I think
<span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>none were unmoved but Michael Fenwick, who
fell fast asleep under an adjoining hayrick.”</p>

<p class='c007'>A higher type of man, but still of the very
plain order of preachers, was Joseph Bradford.
He also was Wesley’s frequent travelling companion,
and he judged no service too servile by
which he could show his reverence for his
master. But on one occasion Wesley directed
him to carry a packet of letters to the post.
The occasion was very extraordinary, and
Bradford wished to hear Wesley’s sermon first.
Wesley was urgent and insisted that the letters
must go. Bradford refused; he would hear the
sermon. “Then,” said Wesley, “you and I
must part!” “Very good, sir,” said Bradford.
The service was over. They slept in the same
room. On rising in the morning, Wesley accosted
his old friend and companion, and asked
if he had considered what had been said,
that they must part. “Yes, sir,” replied
Bradford. “And must we part?” inquired
Wesley. “Please yourself, sir,” was the reply.
“Will you ask my pardon?” rejoined
Wesley. “No, sir.” “You wont?” “No,
sir.” “Then I will ask yours,” replied the
great man. It is said that Bradford melted
under the words, and wept like a child. But
we must not convey the idea that the early
preachers were generally of this order. “In a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>great house there are vessels to honour and
vessels to dishonour.” “Vessels of dishonour”
assuredly were none of these men: but there
were some who attained to a greatness almost
as remarkable as the greatness of the three,
Whitefield and the Wesleys.</p>

<p class='c007'>What a man was John Nelson! His was a
life full of singular incidents. It was truly
apostolic, whether we consider its holy magnanimity,
the violence and vehemence of the
cruel persecutions he encountered, or his singular
power over excited mobs; reminding us
sometimes of Paul fighting as with wild beasts
at Ephesus, or standing with cunning tact, and
disarming at once captain and crowd on the
steps of the Castle at Jerusalem. Then, although
he was but a poor working stonemason,
he had a high gentlemanly bearing, before
which those who considered themselves
gentlemen, magistrates and others, fell back
abashed and ashamed. He was one of the
prophets of Yorkshire; and many of the large
Societies at this day in Leeds, Halifax, and
Bradford owe their foundation to him. It
seems wonderful to us now, that merely preaching
the word of truth, and especially as John
Nelson preached it, with such a cheerful, radiant,
and even heavenly manner, should bring
out mighty mobs to assault him. The stories
<span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>of his itinerancy are innumerable, and his life
is really one of the most romantic in these
preaching annals. At Nottingham, while he
was preaching, the crowds threw squibs at him
and round him; but, as he was still pursuing
his path of speech, a sergeant in the army
pressed up to him, with tears, saying, “In the
presence of God and all this company, I beg
your pardon. I came here on purpose to mob
you, but I have been compelled to hear you;
and I here declare I believe you to be a servant
of the living God!” He threw his arms round
Nelson’s neck, kissed him, and went away
weeping; and we see him no more. Perhaps
more remarkable still was his reception at
Grimsby. There the clergyman of the parish
hired a drummer to gather a great mob, as he
said, “to defend the rights of the Church.”
The storm which raged round Nelson was wild
and ferocious; but it illustrates the power of
this extraordinary man over his rudest hearers,
that after beating his drum for a long time, the
poor drummer threw it away, and stood listening,
the tears running down his cheeks.</p>

<div class='ic002'>
<p><span class='small'>John Nelson at Nottingham.</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Nelson was a man of immense physical
strength; his own trade had fostered this, and
before his conversion he had, no doubt, been
feared as a man who could hit out and hit hard.
As the most effectual means of silencing him,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>he was pressed for a soldier; but John was not
only a Methodist, he had adopted the Quaker
notion that a Christian dare not fight; and he
seems to have been a real torment to the officers
and men of the regiment, who indeed
marched him about different parts of the country,
but could not get him either to accept the
king’s money or to submit to drill. An officer
put him in prison for rebuking his profanity,
and threatened to chastise him. Nelson says,
“It caused a sore temptation to arise in me; to
think that a wicked, ignorant man should thus
torment me, and I able to tie his head and heels
together. I found an old man’s bone in me;
but the Lord lifted up the standard within, else
should I have wrung his neck and set my foot
upon him.”</p>

<p class='c007'>At length, after three months, the Countess
of Huntingdon procured his discharge. The
regiment was in Newcastle. He preached there
on the evening of the day on which he was
liberated, and it is testified that a number of
the soldiers from his regiment came to hear
him, and parted from him with tears. He was
arrested as a vagrant, without any visible
means of living. A gentleman instantly stepped
forward and offered five hundred pounds bail;
but the bail was refused. He was able to
prove that he was a high-charactered, industrious
<span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>workman; but it availed nothing. Crowds
wept and prayed for him as he was borne
through the streets. “Fear not!” he cried,
“oh, friends; God hath His way in the whirlwind,
and in the storm. Only pray that my
faith fail not!” It was at Bradford. They
thrust him into a most filthy dungeon. The
authorities would give him no food. The people
thrust in food, water, and candles. He
shared these with some wretched prisoners in
the same cage, and he sang hymns, and talked
to them all night. He was marched off to
York; but there the excitement was so great
when it was known that John Nelson was coming
a prisoner that armed troops were ordered
out to guard him. He says, “Hell from beneath
was moved to meet me at my coming!”
All the windows were crowded with people—some
in sympathy, but most cheering and huzzaing
as if some great political traitor had been
arrested; but he says, “The Lord made my
brow like brass, so that I could look upon all
the people as grasshoppers, and pass through
the city as if there had been none in it but God
and me.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Such was John Nelson. These anecdotes are
sufficient to show the manner of man he was.
He has been truly called “the proto-martyr of
Methodism.” But it is not in a hint or two that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>all can be said which ought to be said of this
noble and extraordinary man. His conversion,
perhaps, sank down to deeper roots than in
many instances. The thoughts of Methodism
found him perplexed with those agonizing questions
which have tormented men in all ages, until
they have realized the truth as it is in Jesus.
His life was guilty of no immoralities; he had
a happy, humble home, was industrious, and
receiving good wages; but as he walked to
and fro among the fields he was distressed,
“for,” he said, “surely God never made man to
be such a riddle to himself, and to leave him
so.” He heard Wesley preach. “Then,” he
says, “my heart beat like the pendulum of a
clock, and I thought his whole discourse was
aimed at me;” and so, in short, he became a
Methodist, and a Methodist preacher; and
among the noble names in the history of the
Church of Christ, in his own line and order, it
may be doubted whether a nobler name can be
mentioned than that of John Nelson.</p>

<p class='c007'>Quite another order of man, less human,
but equally divine, was Thomas Walsh. His
parents were Romanists, and he was intended
by them for the Romish priesthood; and he
appears to have been an intense Romanist
ascetic until about eighteen years of age. He
had a thoughtful and exceedingly intense nature,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>and his faith was no rest to him. In his
dilemma he heard a Methodist preacher speak
one day from the text, “Come unto Me, all ye
that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give
you rest.” It appears to have been the turning-point
of a remarkable life.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The life of Thomas Walsh,” says Dr.
Southey, “might almost convince a Catholic
that saints were to be found in other communions
as well as in the Church of Rome.”
Walsh became a great biblical scholar; he
was an Irishman, he mastered the native
Irish, that he might preach in it; but Latin,
Greek, and Hebrew became familiar to him;
and of the Hebrew, especially, it is said that
he studied so deeply, that his memory was an
entire concordance of the whole Bible. His
soul was as a flame of fire, but it burnt out the
body quickly. John Wesley says of him, “I do
not remember ever to have known a man who,
in so few years as he remained upon earth, was
the instrument of converting so many sinners.”
He became mighty in his influence over the
Roman Catholics. The priests said that
“Walsh had died some years ago, and that he
who went about preaching, on mountains and
highways, in meadows, private houses, prisons,
and ships, was a devil who had assumed his
shape.” This was the only way in which they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>could account for the extraordinary influence
he possessed. His labours were greatly divided
between Ireland and London, but everywhere
he bore down all before him by a kind of
absorbed ecstasy of ardent faith; but he died at
the age of twenty-seven. While lying on his
death-bed he was oppressed with a sense of
despair, even of his salvation. The sufferings
of his mind on this account were protracted and
intense; at last he broke out in an exclamation,
“He is come! He is come! My Beloved is
mine, and I am His for ever!” and so he fell
back and died. Thomas Walsh is a great name
still in the records of the lay preachers of early
Methodism.</p>

<p class='c007'>All orders of men rose: different from any we
have mentioned was George Story, whose
quiet, but earnest and reasonable nature, seems
to have commanded the especial love of
Southey. He appears never to have become
what some call an enthusiast; but he interestingly
illustrates, that it was not merely over the
rugged and uninformed minds that the power
of the Revival exercised its influence. Very
curiously, he appears to have been converted
by thinking about Eugene Aram, the well-known
scholar, whose name has become so
celebrated in fiction and in poetry, and who
had a short time before been executed for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>murder at York. Story was impressed by the
importance of the acquisition of knowledge,
and Aram’s extraordinary attainments kindled
in his mind a sense of admiration and emulation;
but, as he thought upon his life, he reasoned,
“What did this man’s learning profit him? It
did not save him from becoming a thief and a
murderer, or even from attempting his own
life.” It was an immense suggestion to him; it
led him upon another track of thinking. The
Methodists came through his village; he yielded
himself to the influence, and Dr. Southey
thinks “there is not in the whole biography of
Methodism a more interesting or remarkable
case than his.” He became a great preacher,
but disarmed and convinced men rather by his
calm, dispassionate elevation of manner, than
by such weapons as the cheerful <i>bonhomie</i> of
Nelson, or the fervid fire of Walsh.</p>

<p class='c007'>But we are, perhaps, conveying the idea that
it was only beneath the administration of John
Wesley that these great lay preachers were to
be found. It was not so; but no doubt beneath
that administration their itinerancy became
more systematic and organised. Whitefield
does not appear to have at all shared Wesley’s
prejudices on this means of usefulness; but those
men who fell beneath the influence of Whitefield,
or the Countess, seem soon to meet us as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>settled ministers, in many, if not in all instances.
Among them there are few greater names in
the whole Revival than those of Captain Jonathan
Scott and the renowned Captain Toriel
Joss. Captain Scott was a captain of dragoons,
and one of the heroes of Minden; he was
converted by the instrumentality of William
Romaine, who, in spite of his prejudices against
lay preaching, encouraged him in his excursions,
in which he spoke to immense crowds with
great effect. Fletcher, of Madeley, said, “his
coat shames many a black one.” He was a gentleman
of an ancient and opulent family, and
the Countess, who, naturally, was delighted to
see people of her own order by her side, felt herself
greatly strengthened by him. It was said,
when he preached at Leeds, the whole town
turned out to hear him; and he was one of the
great preachers of the Tabernacle in Moorfields,
during more than twenty years. But yet a far
more famous man was Toriel Joss. He was a
captain of the seas, and had led a life which
somewhat reminds us of Newton’s. He was a
good and even great sailor, but he became a
greater preacher. Whitefield said of these two
men, that “God, who sitteth upon the flood,
can bring a shark from the ocean, and a lion
from the forest, to show forth his praise.” Joss
was a man of property, with a fair prospect of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>considerable wealth, when he renounced the
seas and became one of the great lay preachers.
Whitefield insisted that he should abandon the
chart, the compass, and the deck, and take to
the pulpit. He did so. In London his fame
was second only to that of Whitefield himself.
He became Whitefield’s coadjutor at the Tabernacle,
where, first as associate pastor, and
afterwards as pastor, he continued for thirty
years. The chapel at Tottenham Court Road
was his chief field, and John Berridge called him
“Whitefield’s Archdeacon of Tottenham.”</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>We cannot particularise others: there were
Sampson Staniforth, the soldier, Alexander
Mather, Christopher Hopper, John Haime,
John Parson—and these are only representative
names. There were crowds of them; they
travelled to and fro, with hard fare, throughout
the land. Their excursions were not recreations
or amusements. Attempt to think what
England was at that time. It is a fact that
they often had to swim through streams and
wade through snows to keep their appointments;
often to sleep in summer in the open
air, beneath the trees of a forest. Sometimes a
preacher was seen with a spade strapped to his
back, to cut a way for man and horse through
the heavy snow-drifts. Highwaymen were
abroad, and there are many odd stories about
their encounters with these men; but, then,
usually, they had nothing to lose. Rogers, in
his <i>Lives of the Early Preachers</i>, tells a characteristic
story. One of these lay preachers, as
usual on horseback, was waylaid by three robbers;
one of them seized the bridle of his horse,
the second put a pistol to his head, the third
began to pull him from the saddle—all, of
course, declaring that they would have his
money or his life. The preacher looked solemnly
at them, and asked them “if they had
prayed that morning.” This confounded them
<span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>a little, still they continued their work of plunder.
One pulled out a knife to rip the saddle-bag
open; the preacher said, “There are only
some books and tracts there; as to money, I
have only twopence halfpenny in my pocket;”
he took it out and gave it them. “All that
I have of value about me,” he said, “is my
coat. I am a servant of God; I am going on
His errand to preach; but let me kneel down
and pray with you; that will do you more good
than anything I can give you.” One of them
said, “I will have nothing to do with anything
we can get from this man!” They had taken
his watch; they restored this, and took up the
bags and fastened them again on the horse.
The preacher thanked them for their great
civility to him; “But now,” said he, “I will
pray!” and he fell upon his knees, and prayed
with great power. Two of the rascals, utterly
frightened at this treatment, started off as fast
as their legs could carry them; the third—he
who had first refused to have anything to do
with the job—continued on his knees with the
preacher; and when they parted company he
promised that he would try to lead a new life,
and hoped to become a new man.</p>

<p class='c007'>Should the reader search the old magazines
and documents in which are enshrined the
records of the early days of the Revival, he will
<span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>find many incidents showing what a romantic
story is this of the self-denials, the difficulties,
and enthusiasm of these men, whose best record
is on high—most of them faithful men, like
Alexander Coates, who, after a life of singular
length and usefulness in the work, went to his
rest. His talents were said to be extraordinary,
both in preaching and in conversation.
Just as he was dying, one of his brethren called
upon him and said, “You don’t think you have
followed a cunningly-devised fable now?” “No,
no, no!” said the dying man. “And what do
you see?” “Land ahead!” said the old man.
They were his last words. Such were the men
of this Great Revival; so they lived their lives
of faithful usefulness, and so they passed away.</p>

</div>
<p class='c006'>If we were writing a sustained history of the
Revival, we might devote some pages, at this
period, to notice the varied forms of satire and
ribaldry by which it was greeted. While the
noble bands of preachers were pursuing their
way, instructing and awakening the popular
mind of the country, not only heartless and
affected dilettanti, like Horace Walpole, regarded
it with the condescension of their supercilious
sneers, but for the more popular taste
there was <i>The Spiritual Quixote</i>, a book which
even now has its readers, and in which Whitefield
and his followers were held up to ridicule;
and Lackington, the great bookseller, in his
disgraceful, but entertaining autobiography, attempted
to cover the Societies of Wesley with
his scurrility. It was about the year 1750 that
<i>The Minor</i> was brought out on the stage of the
Haymarket Theatre; the author was that great
comedian, but most despicable and dissolute
character, Foote. The play lies before us as
we write; we have taken it down to notice the
really shameless buffoonery and falsehood in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>which it indulges. Whitefield is especially
libelled and burlesqued. The Countess of
Huntingdon waited personally on the Lord
Chamberlain, and besought him to suppress it;
it was not much to the credit of his lordship’s
knowledge, that he declared, had he known the
evil influence of the thing before it was licensed,
it should not have been produced, but being
licensed, it was beyond his control. Then the
good Countess waited on David Garrick; Garrick
knew and admired Whitefield; he received
her with distinguished kindness and respect,
and it is to his honour that, through his influence,
it was temporarily suppressed. It seems
a singular compensation that the author of this
piece, who permitted himself to indulge in the
most disgraceful insinuations against one of the
holiest and purest of men, a few years after was
charged with a great crime, of which he was,
no doubt, quite innocent, and died a broken-hearted
and beggared man.</p>

<p class='c007'>Another of these disgraceful stage libels, <i>The
Hypocrite</i>, appeared at Drury Lane in 1768; in
it are the well-known characters of Dr. Cantwell,
and Mawworm, and old Lady Lambert.
There is more of a kind of genius in it than in
<i>The Minor</i>, but it was all stolen property, and
little more than an appropriation from Molière’s
<i>Tartuffe</i> and Cibber’s <i>Nonjuror</i>. All these
<span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>things are forgotten now; but they are worthy
of notice as entering into the history of the
Revival, and showing the malice which was
stirred in multitudes of minds against men and
designs, on the whole, so innocent and holy.
Was it not written from of old, “The carnal
mind is enmity against God”?</p>

<p class='c007'>But as to the movement itself, companions-in-arms,
and of a very high order alike for valour
and character, crowded to the field; we
have referred to several distinguished laymen;
it is at least equally important to notice that
while the leaders of the Church were, as a
body, set in array against it—while archbishops
and bishops of that day frowned, or scoffed
and scorned, there were a number of clergymen
whose piety, whose wit and eloquence, whose
affluent humour, whose learning, whose intrepidity
and sleepless variety of labour, surround
their names, even now as then, with a charm
of interest, making every life as it comes before
us a readable and delightful recreation. Some
of them were assuredly oddities; it is not long
since we made a pilgrimage to Everton, in
Bedfordshire, to read the singular epitaph, on
the tomb in the churchyard, of one of the oddest
and most extraordinary of all these men.
Even if our readers have read that epitaph, it
will do them no harm to read it again:</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>

    <div>The earthly remains of</div>
    <div><span class='sc'>John Berridge</span>,</div>
    <div>Late Vicar of Everton,</div>
    <div>And an itinerant servant of Jesus Christ,</div>
    <div>Who loved his Master, and His work,</div>
    <div>And after running on His errands many years,</div>
    <div>Was called up to wait on Him above.</div>
    <div>Reader,</div>
    <div>Art thou born again?</div>
    <div>No salvation without a New Birth!</div>

    <div>Fled to Jesus alone for refuge, 1756.</div>
    <div>Fell asleep in Christ Jesus, January 22, 1793.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>With the exception of the date of his death,
it was written by the hand that moulders beneath
the stone; it is characteristic that its
writer caused himself to be buried in that part
of the churchyard where, up to that time, only
those had been interred who had destroyed
themselves, or come to an ignominious end.
Before his death he had often said that he
would take this effectual means of consecrating
that unhallowed spot.</p>

<p class='c007'>This epitaph sufficiently shows that John
Berridge was an original character. Southey
says of him that he was a buffoon and a fanatic.
Southey’s judgments about the men of the Revival
<span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>were frequently as shallow as they were
unjust; he must have felt a sharp sting when,
as doubtless was the case, he heard the well-known
anecdote of George IV., who, on reading
Richard Watson’s calm reply to Southey’s
attacks on the Methodist leaders, exclaimed,
as he laid down the book, “Oh, my poor Poet
Laureate!” He deserved all that and a good
deal more, if only for the verdict we have
quoted on Berridge. So far as scholarship may
test a man, John Berridge was most likely a
far deeper scholar than Dr. Southey; he was a
distinguished member of Clare Hall, Cambridge,
and for many years read and studied fourteen
hours a day; but he was an uncontrollable droll
and humourist; pithy proverbs fell spontaneously
along all his speech. As one critic says of
his style, “It was like granulated salt.” As a
preacher, he was equal to any multitudes; he
lived among farmers and graziers, and the
twinkling of his eye, all alive with shrewd
cheerfulness, compelled attention even before
he opened his lips. The late Dr. Guthrie, not
long before his death, thought it worth his
while to republish <i>The Christian World Unmasked;
pray Come and Peep</i>; and it is characteristic
of Berridge throughout.</p>

<p class='c007'>After his conversion, his Bishop called him
up and threatened to send him to gaol for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>preaching out of his parish. Our readers may
imagine with such a man what sort of conference
it was, and which of the two would be
likely to get the worst of it: “I tell you,” said
the Bishop, “if you continue preaching where
you have no right, you are very likely to be
sent to Huntingdon Gaol.” “I have no more
regard for a gaol than other folks,” said he;
“but I would rather go there with a good conscience
than be at liberty without one.” The
conference is too long for quotation, but Berridge
held on his way; he became one of the
most beloved and intimate friends of the
Countess of Huntingdon; and if he shocked his
bishop by preaching out of his own parish, he
must have roused his wrath by preaching in
her ladyship’s chapel in London, and throughout
the country. His letters to the Countess
are as characteristic as his speech, or any other
of his writings. Thus he writes to her about
young Rowland Hill, “I find you have got
honest Rowland down to Bath; he is a pretty
young spaniel, fit for land or water, and he has
a wonderful yelp; he forsakes father and mother
and brethren, and gives up all for Jesus, and I
believe he will prove a useful labourer if he
keeps clear of petticoat snares.” No doubt,
Berridge sometimes seemed not only racy, but
rude; but his words were wonderfully calculated
<span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>to meet the average and level of an immense
congregation. While he lived on terms
of fellowship with all the great leaders of the
movement, he was faithful as the vicar of his
own parish, and was the apostle of the whole
region of Bedfordshire.</p>

<p class='c007'>With all his shrewd worldly wisdom, Berridge
had a most benevolent hand; he was rich,
and devoted far more than the income of his
vicarage to helping his poor neighbours, supporting
itinerant ministers, renting houses
and barns for preaching the Gospel, and, however
far he travelled to preach, always disbursing
his expenses from his own pocket. How
he would have loved John Bunyan, and how
John Bunyan would have loved him! It is
curious that within a few miles of the place
where the illustrious dreamer was so long
imprisoned, one should arise out of the very
Church which persecuted Bunyan, to do for a
long succession of years, on the same ground,
the work for which he was persecuted.</p>

<p><span class='small'>Haworth Church.</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>From the low Bedford level, what a flight to
the wildest spot in wild Yorkshire, Haworth,
and its venerable old parish church, celebrated
now as a classic region, haunted by the memory
of the author of <i>Jane Eyre</i>, and all the Brontë
family; but in the times of which we are writing,
the vicar, William Grimshaw, was quite as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span>queer and quaint a creature as Berridge. A
wild spot now—a stern, grand place; desolate
moors still seeming to stretch all round it;
though more easily reached in this day, it must
indeed have been a rough solitude when William
Grimshaw became its vicar, in 1742. He was
born in 1708; he died in 1763. He was a man
something of the nature of the wild moors
around him. When he became the pastor of
the parish, the people all round him were
plunged in the most sottish heathenism. The
pastor was a kind of son of the desert, and he
became such an one as the Baptist, crying in
the wilderness. The people were rough, they
perhaps needed a rough shepherd; they had
one. The character of Grimshaw is that of a
rough, faithful, and not less beautiful shepherd’s
dog. On the Sabbath morning he would commence
his service, giving out the psalm, and
having taken note of the absentees from the
congregation, would start off, while the psalm
was being sung, to drive in the loiterers, visiting
the ale-houses, routing out the drinkers, and
literally compelling them to come into the
parish church. One Sabbath morning, a
stranger riding through Haworth, seeing some
men scrambling over a garden wall, and some
others leaping through a low window, imagined
the house was on fire. He inquired what was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>the matter. One of them cried out, “The
parson’s a coming!” and that explained the
riddle. Upon another occasion, as a man was
passing through the village, on the Sabbath
day, on his way to call a doctor, his horse lost
a shoe. He found his way to the village
smithy to have his loss repaired. The blacksmith
told him that it was the Lord’s day, and the
work could not be done unless the minister
gave his permission. So they went to the parson,
who, of course, as the case was urgent and
necessary, gave his consent. But the story
illustrates the mastery the vicar attained over
the rough minds around him. He was a man
of a hardy mould. He was intensely earnest.
He not only effected a mighty moral change in
his own parish, but Haworth was visited every
Sabbath by pilgrims from miles round to listen
to this singular, strong, mountain voice; so that
the church became unequal to the great congregations,
and he often had to preach in the
churchyard, a desolate looking spot now, but
alive with mighty concourses then. It is said
that his strong, pithy words haunted men long
after they were spoken, as the infidel nobleman,
who, in an affected manner, told him he was
unable to see the truth of Christianity. “The
fault,” said the rough vicar, “is not so much in
your lordship’s head as in your heart.”</p>

<p><span class='small'>GRIMSHAW’S HOUSE.</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Grimshaw was the first who kindled in the
wild heights of Yorkshire the flames of the
Revival. His mind was stirred simultaneously
with others, but he does not appear to have
received either from Whitefield or Wesley the
impulses which created his extraordinary character,
though he, of course, entered heartily
into all their work. They visited Haworth,
and preached to immense concourses there.
As to Grimshaw himself, in the most irregular
<span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>manner, he preached in the Methodist conventicles
and dissenting chapels in all the country
round. He effected an entire change in his
own neighbourhood. He put down the races;
he reformed the village feasts, wakes, and fairs.
He was often expecting suspension, and at last
he was cited before the Archbishop, who inquired
of him as to the number of his communicants.
“How many,” said his grace, “had
you when you first went to Haworth?”
“Twelve.” “And how many now?” “In the
summer, about twelve hundred.” The astonished
Archbishop turned to his assistants in
the examination, and said, “I really cannot
find fault with Mr. Grimshaw when he brings so
many people to the Lord’s Table.” Southey is
also complimentary, in his own way, to this
singular clergyman, and says, “He was certainly
mad!”</p>

<p><span class='small'>William Grimshaw.</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>It was what Festus said to Paul; but the
madness of the pastor of Haworth was a blessing
to the farms and cottages of those wild
moorlands. He was a child of nature in her
most beautiful moods, glorified by Divine grace.
The freshness and buoyancy of the heath his
foot so lightly pressed, and the torrents which
sung around him, were but typical of his hardy
naturalness and beauty of character. Truly it
has been said, it was not more natural that the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_169'>169</span>gentle lover of nature should lie at the foot of
Helvellyn, than that this watchman of the
mountains should sleep at the foot of the hills
amongst which he had so faithfully laboured.
He died comparatively young. His last words
were very characteristic. Robert Shaw, an old
Methodist preacher, called upon him; he said,
“I will pray for you as long as I live, and if
there is praying in heaven, I will pray for you
there; I am as happy as I can be on earth, and
as sure of glory as if I were in it.” His last
words were, “Here goes an unprofitable servant!”</p>

<p class='c007'>The wild Yorkshire of that day took up the
Revival with a will; and Henry Venn, of Huddersfield,
we suppose, has even transcended by
his usefulness the fame of either Berridge or
Grimshaw; he was born in 1724, and died in
1797. His life was genial and fruitful, and to
his church in Huddersfield the people poured
in droves to listen to him. It has been said his
life was like a field of wheat, or a fine summer
day. And how are these to be painted or put
upon the canvas? He could scarcely be called
eccentric, excepting in the sense in which
earnestness, holiness, and usefulness are always
eccentric. His influence may be said, in some
directions, to continue still. He was one of the
indefatigable coadjutors of the Countess in all
<span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span>her work, and towards the close of his life he
came to London to throw his influence round
young Rowland Hill, by preaching for some
time in Surrey Chapel.</p>

<p class='c007'>In another district of Yorkshire, a mighty
movement was going on, commencing about
1734. Benjamin Ingham, whom we met some
time since at Oxford, as a member of the Holy
Club, was living at Ossett, near Dewsbury. He
had married Lady Margaret Hastings, a
younger sister of the Countess of Huntingdon.
He had received ordination in the Church of
England, but his irregularities had forced him
out. Like the Wesleys, in the earlier part of
his history, he became enchanted with the
devotional life of the Moravians, and at this
period he introduced with marvellous results a
modified Moravianism into the West Riding of
Yorkshire. He founded as many as eighty
Societies; but he appears to have attempted to
carry out an impossible scheme, the union of
the Moravian discipline and doctrine with his
idea of Congregationalism. His influence over
the West Riding for a long time was immense;
but, most naturally, divisions arose, and the
purely Moravian element separated itself into
its own order of Church life, while the Methodist
element was absorbed in the great and growing
Wesleyan Societies. He was a friend of Count
<span class='pageno' id='Page_171'>171</span>Zinzendorf, who was his guest for a long time
at Ledstone House. The shock which his
Society sustained, and the death of Lady
Margaret, his admirable and beloved wife,
were blows from which the good man never
recovered; but the effects of his usefulness continued,
although he passed; and if the reader
ever visits the little Moravian Colony and
Institution of Fulneck, near Leeds, in Yorkshire,
he may be pleased to remember that
this is also one of the offshoots of the Great
Revival.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is a sudden leap from the West Riding of
Yorkshire to Truro, the charming little capital
of Western Cornwall. We are here met by
an imperishable and beautiful name, that of
Samuel Walker, the minister; he was born in
1714, and died in 1761. His influence over his
town was great and abiding, and Walker of
Truro is a name which to this day retains its
fragrance, as associated with the restoration of
his town from wild depravity to purity and exemplary
piety.</p>

<p class='c007'>How impossible it is to do more than merely
mention the names of men, every action of
whose lives was consecrated, and every breath
an ardent flame, all helping on and urging forward
the great work of rousing a careless world
and a careless Church. What an influence had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>William Romaine, who for a long time, it has
been said, was one of the sights of London; it
was rather drolly put when it was said, “People
came from the country to see Garrick act and
to hear Romaine preach!” Nor let our readers
suppose that he was a mere sensational orator;
he was a great scholar. We hear of him first
as the Gresham Professor of Astronomy, and
the editor of the four volumes of Calasio’s
<i>Hebrew Concordance</i>; then he caught the
evangelic fire; he became one of the chaplains
of the Countess of Huntingdon, and, so far as
the Church of the Establishment was concerned,
he was the most considerable light of
London for a period of nearly fifty years; and
very singular was his history in this relation,
especially in some of the churches whose pulpits
he filled. It seems singular to us now how
even his great talents could obtain for him the
place of morning lecturer at St. George’s, Hanover
Square; but the charge was soon urged
against him that he vulgarised that most
fashionable of congregations, and most uncomfortably
crowded the church. He was appointed
evening lecturer at St. Dunstan’s in Fleet
Street; but the rector barred his entrance into
the pulpit, seating himself there during the
time of prayers, so that the preacher might be
unable to enter. Lord Mansfield decided that,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_173'>173</span>after seven in the evening, the church was not
the rector’s, but that Mr. Romaine was entitled
to the use of it; then, at seven in the evening,
the churchwardens closed the church doors,
and kept the congregation outside, wearying
them in the rain or in the cold. At length, the
patience of the churchwardens gave way before
the persistency of the people and the preacher;
but it was an age of candles, and they refused
to light the church, and Mr. Romaine often
preached in a crowded church by the light of
one candle. They paid him the merest minimum
which he could demand, or which they
were compelled to pay; sometimes only eighteen
pounds a year. But he was a hardy man,
and he lived on the plainest fare, and dressed
in homespun cloth. He was dragged repeatedly
before courts of law, but he was as difficult
to manage here as in the church; he brought
his judges to the statutes, none of which he
had broken. Every effort was made to expel
him from the Church, but he would not be cast
out; and at last he appears to have settled himself,
as such men generally do, into an irresistible
fact. He became the Rector of St. Ann’s,
Blackfriars. There he preached those sermons
which were shaped afterwards into the favourite
book of our forefathers, <i>The Life, Walk, and
Triumph of Faith</i>. Born in 1714, he died in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_174'>174</span>1795. His last years were clothed with a pleasant
serenity, although, perhaps, some have detected
in his character marks of a severity,
probably the result of those conflicts which,
through so many years, he had with such remarkable
consistency sustained.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>And surely we ought to mention, in this right
noble band, John Newton; but he brings us
<span class='pageno' id='Page_177'>177</span>near to the time when the passion of the Revival
was settling itself into organisation and
calm; when the fury of persecution was ceasing;
Methodism was becoming even a respectable
and acknowledged fact. John Newton was
born in 1725, and died in 1807. All his sympathies
were with the theology and the activities
of the revivalists; but before he most singularly
found himself the Rector of St. Mary
Woolnoth, and St. Mary Woolchurch, he had
led a life which, for its marvellous variety of
incident, reads like one of Defoe’s fictions.</p>

<div class='ic002'>
<p><span class='small'>St. Mary Woolnoth.<br />John Newton.</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>But his parlour in No. 8 Coleman Street
Buildings, on a Friday evening, was thronged
by all the dignitaries of the evangelical movement
of his day. As he said, “I was a wild
beast on the coast of Africa, but the Lord
caught me and tamed me; and now you come
to see me as people go to see the lions in the
Tower.” A grand old man was John Newton,
the young sailor transformed into the saintly
old rector; there he sat with few traces of the
parson about him, in his blue pea-jacket, and
his black neckerchief, liking still to retain
something of the freedom of his old blue seas;
full of quaint wisdom, which never, like that of
his friend Berridge, became rude or droll; quietly
sitting there and meditating; his enthusiastic
life apparently having subsided into stillness,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>while the Hannah Mores, Wilberforces,
Claudius Buchanans, and John Campbells, went
to him to find their enthusiasm confirmed.
The friend of Cowper, who surely deserves to
be called the Poet Laureate of the Revival—himself
the author of some of the sweetest hymns
we still sing; the biographer of his own wonderful
career, and of the life of his friend and
brother-in-arms, William Grimshaw; one of the
finest of our religious letter-writers; with capacities
within him for almost everything he
might have thought it wise to undertake, he
now seems to us appropriately to close this
small gallery we have attempted to present.
When the spirit of the Revival was either settling
into firmness and consolidation, or striking
out into those new and marvellous fields of
labour—its natural outgrowth—which another
chapter may present succinctly to the eye, John
Newton, by his great experience of men, his
profound faith, his steady hand and clear eye,
became the wise adviser and fosterer of schemes
whose gigantic enterprise would certainly have
astonished even his capacious intelligence.</p>

<p class='c007'>In closing this chapter it is quite worth while
to notice that, various as were the characters
of these men, and of their innumerable comrades,
to whom we do homage, although we
have no space even to mention their names,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_179'>179</span>their strength arose from the certainty and the
confidence with which they spoke; there was
nothing tentative about their teaching. That
great scholar, Sir William Hamilton, says that
“assurance is the <i>punctum saliens</i>, that is the
strong point of Luther’s system;” so it was with
all these men, “We speak that we do know,
and testify that we have seen;” it was the full
assurance of knowledge; and it gave them authority
over the men with whom they wrestled,
whether in public or private. Whitefield and
Wesley alike, and all their followers, had strong
faith in God. They were believers in the personal
regard of God for the souls of men; and
every idea of prayer supposes some such personal
regard, whether offered by the highest of
high Calvinists, or the simplest primitive Methodist;
the whole spirit of the Revival turned on
this; these men, as they strongly believed,
were able, by the strong attractive force of their
own nature, to compel other minds to their
convictions. Their history strongly illustrates
that that teaching which oscillates to and fro
in a pendulous uncertainty is powerless to reform
character or influence mind.</p>

</div>
<p class='c006'>The preceding chapters have shown that the
Great Revival was creating over the wild moral
wastes of England a pure and spiritual atmosphere,
and its movements and organisations
were taking root in every direction. Voltaire,
and that pedantic cluster of conceited infidels,
the Bolingbrokes, Middletons, and Mandevilles,
Chubbs, Woolstons, and Collinses, who
prophesied that Christian faith was fast vanishing
from the earth, were slightly premature. It
is, indeed, interesting to notice the contrast in
this period between England and the then most
unhappy sister-kingdom of France: there, indeed,
Christian faith did seem to be trodden
underfoot of men. While a great silent, hallowed
revolution was going on in one, all
things were preparing for a tremendous revolution
in the other. It was just about the time
that the Revival was leavening English society
that Lord Chesterfield summed up what he had
noticed in France, in the following words: “In
short, all the symptoms which I have ever met
<span class='pageno' id='Page_181'>181</span>with in history previous to great changes and
revolutions in government, now exist and daily
increase in France.” The words were spoken
several years before that terrible Revolution
came, which conducted the King, the Queen,
and almost all the aristocracy, respectability,
and lingering piety of the nation to the scaffold.
It was a wonderful compensation. A few
years before, a sovereign had cast away from
his nation, and from around his throne, all the
social elements which could guard and give
dignity to it; how natural, then, that the whole
<i>canaille</i> of the kingdom should rush upon the
throne of his successor, and cast it and its occupant
into the bonfire of the Reign of Terror!</p>

<p class='c007'>In Britain, from some cause, all was different.
This period of the Revival has been truly called
the starting-point of the modern religious history
of that land; and, somehow, all things
were singularly combining to give to the nation
a new-born happiness, to create new facilities
for mental growth and culture, and to enlarge
and to fill their cup of national joy. It will be
noticed that these things did not descend to
the nation generally from the highest places of
the land. With the exception of the sovereign,
we cannot see many instances of a lively interest
in the moral well-being of the people.
Other exceptions there were, but they were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_182'>182</span>very few. From the people themselves, and
from the causes we have described, originated
and spread those means which, amidst the wild
agitations of revolution, as they came foaming
over the Channel, and which were rather aided
than repressed by the unwisdom of many of
the governments and magistrates, calmed and
enlightened the public mind, and secured the
order of society, and the stability of the throne.</p>

<p class='c007'>The historians of Wesleyanism—we will say
it respectfully, but still very firmly—have been
too uniformly disposed to see in their own society
the centre and the spring of all those
amazing means of social regeneration to which
the period of the Revival gave birth. Dr. Abel
Stevens specially seems to regard Methodism
and Wesleyanism as conterminous. It would
seem from him that the work of the printing-office,
the book or the tract society, schools
and missions, and the various means of social
amelioration or redemption, all have their
origin in Wesleyanism. We may give the
largest honour to the venerable name of Wesley,
and accept this history by Dr. Stevens as
the best, yet as an American he did not fully
know what had been done by others not in the
Connexion. There was an immense field of
Methodism which did not fall beneath the dominion
of Wesley, and had no relation to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_183'>183</span>Wesleyan Conference. The same spirit touched
simultaneously many minds, quite separated by
ecclesiastical and social relations, but all
wrought up to the same end. These pages
have been greatly devoted to reminiscences of
the great preachers, and illustrations of the
preaching power of the Revival, but our readers
know that the Revival did not end in
preaching. These voices stirred the slumbering
mind of the nation like a thunder-peal, but
they roused to work and practical effort. The
great characteristic of all that came out of the
movement may be summed up in the often-quoted
expression, “A single eye to the glory
of God.” As one of the clergymen of Yorkshire,
earnest and active in those times, was
wont to say, “I do love those one-eyed Christians.”</p>

<p class='c007'>We shall have occasion to mention the name
of Robert Raikes, and that name reminds us not
only of Gloucester, but of Gloucestershire; many
circumstances gave to that most charming county
a conspicuous place. Lying in the immediate
neighbourhood of Bath, it attracted the attention
of the Countess of Huntingdon. “As sure
as God is in Gloucestershire,” was an old proverb,
first used in monastic days, then applied to the
Reformation time, when Tyndale, the first
translator of the English New Testament, had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_184'>184</span>his home in the lovely village of North Nibley;
but it became yet more true when Whitefield
preached to the immense concourses on Stinchcombe
Hill; when Rodborough and Ebley, and
the valley of the Stroud Water were lit up with
Revival beacons, and when Rowland Hill
established his vicarage at Wotton-under-Edge;
then, in its immediate neighbourhood,
arose that beautiful Christian worker, the close
friend of George Whitefield, Cornelius Winter;
and from his labours came forth his most
eminent pupil, and great preacher, William
Jay.</p>

<p class='c007'>And the Revival took effect on distinct circles
which certainly seemed outside of the Methodist
movement, but which yet, assuredly, belonged
to it; the Clapham Sect, for instance. “The
Clapham Sect” is a designation originating in
the facetious and satiric brain of Sydney Smith,
than whom the Revival never had a more
unjust, ungenerous, or ungracious critic; but the
pages of the <i>Edinburgh Review</i>, in which the
flippant sting of speech first appeared, years
afterwards consecrated the term and made it
historical in the elegant essay of Sir James
Stephen. By his pen the sect, with all its
leaders, acts, and consequences, are pleasantly
described in the <i>Essays on Ecclesiastical
Biography</i>; and surely this was as much the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_185'>185</span>result of the Great Revival as the “evangelical
succession” which calls forth the exercise in
previous pages of the same interesting pen; it
was all a natural evangelical succession, that of
which we have spoken before, as enthusiasm
for humanity growing out of enthusiasm for
Divine truth. Men who have become fairly
impressed by a sense of their own immortality
and its redemption in Christ, become interested
in the temporal well-being and the eternal
welfare of others. It has always been so, and
is so still, that men who have not a sense of
man’s immortal welfare have usually cared but
little about his temporal interests. Hospitals
and churches, orphanages and missionary
societies, usually grow out of the same spiritual
root.</p>

<p class='c007'>We scarcely need ask our readers to accompany
us to the pleasant little village of Clapham,
and its sweet sequestered Common, then
so far removed from the great metropolis;
surrounded by the homes of wealthy men,
merchants, statesmen, eminent preachers, all
of them infected with the spirit of the Revival,
and all of them noteworthy in the story of those
means which were to shiver the chains of the
slave, to carry light to dark heathen minds,
and to hand out the Bible to English villages
and far-off nations. We have been desirous of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_186'>186</span>conveying the impression that those were times
of a singular and almost simultaneous spiritual
upheaval; it was as if, in different regions of the
great lake of humanity, submerged islands suddenly
appeared from beneath the waves; and it
is not too much to say that all those various
means which have so tended to beautify and
bless the world, schemes of education, schemes
for the improvement of prison discipline,
schemes of missionary enterprise for the extension
of Christian influence in the East Indies,
the destruction of slavery in the West Indies,
and the abolition of the slave trade throughout
the British Empire; Bible societies and Tract
societies, and, in fact, the whole munificent
machinery and organisation of our day, sprang
forth from that revival of the last century. It
seems now like a magnificent burst of enthusiasm;
yet, ultimately it was based upon only
two or three great elements of faith: the
spiritual world was an intense reality; the soul
of every man, woman, and child on the face of
the earth had an endowment of immortality;
they were precious to the Redeemer, they
ought, therefore, to be precious to all the followers
of the Redeemer. Charged with these
truths, their spirits inflamed to a holy enthusiasm
by them, from parlours and drawing-rooms,
from the lowly homes and cottages of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_189'>189</span>England, all these new professors appeared to
be in search of occasions for doing good; the
schemes worked themselves through all the
varieties of human temperament and imperfection;
but, looking back, it must surely be
admitted that they achieved glorious results.</p>

which was the house in which John Shore, the
great Lord Teignmouth, the first President of
the Bible Society, lived, his soul within him
might be a little vexed to be informed that
yonder large building at the extreme corner of
the common, the great Roman Catholic Redemptionist
College, is the house. There, were
canvassed and brooded over a number of the
schemes to which we have referred. Thither
from his own house, close to the well-known
“Plough”—its site now covered by suburban
shops—went the great Zachary Macaulay,
sometimes accompanied by his son, a bright,
intelligent lad, afterwards known as Thomas
Babington Macaulay. John Shore had been
Governor of India, at Calcutta. On the common
resided also, for some time, William Wilberforce.
These were the great statesmen who
were desirous of organising great plans, from
which the consummating prayer of David in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_190'>190</span>72nd Psalm should be realised. Then there
was another house on the common, the mansion
of John Thornton, which seemed to share with
that of Lord Teignmouth the honours of these
Divine committees of ways and means. Before
the establishment of the Bible Society, Mr.
Thornton had been in the habit of spending
two thousand pounds a year in the distribution
of Bibles and Testaments—a very Bible Society
in himself. It is, perhaps, not too much to say,
there was scarcely a thought which had for its
object the well-being of the human family but
it found its representation and discussion in
those palatial abodes on Clapham Common.
There were Granville Sharp and Thomas
Clarkson; thither, how often went cheery old
John Newton, to whom, first of all, on arriving
in London, went every holy wayfarer from the
provinces, wayfarers who soon found their
entrance beneath his protecting wing, and
cheery introduction to these pleasant circles.
Beneath the incentives of his animating words,
the fervid earnestness of Claudius Buchanan
found its pathway of power, and <i>The Star of the
East</i>—his great sermon on “Missions to
India,”—was first seen shining over Clapham
Common; and it was the same genial tongue
which encouraged that fine, but almost forgotten
man, John Campbell, in the enterprise of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_191'>191</span>his spirit, to pierce into the deserts of Africa.
We may notice how great ideas perpetuate
themselves into generations, when we remember
that it was John Campbell who first took
out Robert Moffat, and settled him down in the
field of his wonderful labours.</p>

<p class='c007'>Sir James Stephen, in his admirable paper, is
far from exhausting all the memories of that
Clapham Sect. There was another house, not
in Clapham, but not far removed—Hatcham
House, as we remember it—a noble mansion,
standing in its park, opposite where the old
lane turned off from the main road to Peckham.
There lived Joseph Hardcastle—certainly one
of the Clapham Sect—Wilberforce’s close and
intimate friend, a munificent merchant prince,
in whose offices in the City were held for a long
time all the earliest committee meetings of the
Bible Society, the Religious Tract Society, and
the London Missionary Society, and from whom
appear to have emanated the first suggestions
for the limitation of the powers of the East India
Company in supporting and sanctioning, by
the English Government, Hindoo infanticide
and idolatry. Among all the glorious names
of the Clapham Sect, not one shines out more
beautifully than that of this noble Christian
gentleman.</p>

<p class='c007'>Perhaps a natural delicacy withheld Sir James
<span class='pageno' id='Page_192'>192</span>Stephen from chronicling the story of his own
father, Sir George Stephen; and there was
Thomas Gisborne, most charming of English
preachers of the Church of England evangelical
school; and Sir Robert Grant, whose hymns
are still among the sweetest in our national
psalmody. But we can do no more than thus
say that it was from hence that the spirit of the
Revival rose in new strength, and taking to itself
the wings of the morning, spread to the uttermost
parts of the earth.</p>

</div>
<p class='c006'>In the year 1880 was celebrated in England
and America the centenary of Sunday-schools.
The life and labours of Robert Raikes, whose
name has long been familiar as “a household
word” in connection with such institutions,
were reviewed, and fresh interest added to that
early work for the young.</p>

<p><span class='small'>ROBERT RAIKES AND HIS SCHOLARS.</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Gloucestershire, if not one of the largest, is
certainly one of the fairest—as, indeed, its name
is said to imply: from <i>Glaw</i>, an old British
word signifying “fair”—it is one of the fairest,
and it ought to be one of the most famous,
counties of England. Many are its distinguished
worthies: John de Trevisa was Vicar of Berkeley,
in Gloucestershire, and a contemporary
with John Wyclif, and, like him, he had a strong
aversion to the practices of the Church of Rome,
and an earnest desire to make the Scriptures
known to his parishioners; and in Nibley, in
Gloucestershire, was born, and lived, William
Tyndale, in whose noble heart the great idea
<span class='pageno' id='Page_194'>194</span>sprang up that Christian Englishmen should
read the New Testament in their own mother-tongue,
and who said to a celebrated priest,
“If God spares my life, I will take care that a
plough-boy shall know more of the Scriptures
than you do.” The story of the great translator
<span class='pageno' id='Page_195'>195</span>and martyr is most interesting. Gloucestershire
has been famous, too, for its contributions
to the noble army of martyrs, notably, not
only James Baynham, but, in Gloucester, its
bishop, John Hooper, was in 1555 burnt to
death. In Berkeley the very distinguished
physician, and first promulgator of the doctrine
of vaccination, Dr. Edward Jenner, the son of
the vicar, was born; and from the Old Bell, in
Gloucester, went forth the wonderful preacher
George Whitefield, to arouse the sleeping
Church in England and America from its lethargy.
The quaint old proverb to which we
have already alluded—“As sure as God is in
Gloucestershire”—was very complimentary, but
not very correct; it arose from the amazing
ecclesiastical wealth of the county, which was
so rich that it attracted the notice of the papal
court, and four Italian bishops held it in succession
for fifty years; one of these, Giulio de
Medici, became Pope Clement VII., succeeding
Pope Leo X. in the papacy in 1523. This eminent
ecclesiastical fame no doubt originated
the proverb; but it acquired a tone of reality
and truth rather from the martyrdom of its
bishop than from the elevation of his predecessor
to the papal tiara; rather from Tyndale,
William Sarton, and his brother weaver-martyrs,
than from its costly and magnificent endowments;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_196'>196</span>from Whitefield and Jenner rather
than from its crowd of priests and friars.</p>

<p class='c007'>Thus Gloucestershire has certainly considerable
eminence among English counties. To
other distinguished names must be added that
of Robert Raikes, who must ever be regarded
as the founder of Sabbath-schools. It is not
intended by this that there had never been any
attempts made to gather the children on the
Sabbath for some kind of religious instruction—although
such attempts were very few, and a
diligent search has probably brought them
all [?] under our knowledge; but the example
and the influence of Raikes gave to the idea the
character of a movement; it stirred the whole
country, from the throne itself, the King and
Queen, the bishops, and the clergy; all classes
of ministers and laymen became interested in
what was evidently an easy and happy method
of seizing upon the multitudes of lost children
who in that day were “perishing for lack of
knowledge.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Joseph Stratford, in his <i>Biographical
Sketches of the Great and Good Men in Gloucestershire</i>,
and Mr. Alfred Gregory, in his <i>Life
of Robert Raikes</i>—to which works we must
confess our obligation for much of the information
contained in this chapter—have both done
honour to the several humbler and more obscure
<span class='pageno' id='Page_197'>197</span>labourers whose hearts were moved to attempt
the work to which Raikes gave a national importance,
and which from his hands, and from
his time, became henceforth a perpetual institution
in the Church work of every denomination
of Christian believers and labourers. The
Rev. Joseph Alleine, the author of <i>The Alarm
to the Unconverted</i>, an eminent Nonconformist
minister of Taunton, adopted the plan of
gathering the young people together for instruction
on the Lord’s day. Even in Gloucestershire,
before Raikes was born, in the village
of Flaxley, on the borders of the Forest of
Dean—Flaxley, of which the poet Bloomfield
sings:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“’Mid depths of shade gay sunbeams broke</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Through noble Flaxley’s bowers of oak;</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Where many a cottage, trim and gay,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Whispered delight through all the way:”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c018'>in the old Cistercian Abbey, Mrs. Catharine
Boevey, the lady of the abbey, had one of the
earliest and pleasantest Sabbath-schools. Her
monument in Flaxley Church, erected after
her death in 1726, records her “clothing and
feeding her indigent neighbours, and teaching
their children, some of whom she entertained
at her house, and examined them herself.” Six
of the poor children, it is elsewhere stated,
“by turns dined at her residence on Sundays,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_198'>198</span>and were afterwards heard say the Catechism.”</p>
<p class='c007'>We read of a humbler labourer, realising,
perhaps, more the idea of a Sabbath-school
teacher, in Bolton, in Lancashire, James Hey,
or “Old Jemmy o’ th’ Hey.” Old Jemmy, Mr.
Gregory tells us, employed the working days
of the week in winding bobbins for weavers,
and on Sundays he taught the boys and girls
of the neighbourhood to read. His school
assembled twice each Sunday, in the cottage of
a neighbour, and the time of commencing was
announced, not by the ringing of a bell, but by
an excellent substitute, an old brass pestle and
mortar. After a while, Mr. Adam Compton, a
paper manufacturer in the neighbourhood,
began to supply Jemmy with books, and subscriptions
in money were given him; he was
thus enabled to form three branch establishments,
the teachers of which were paid one
shilling each Sunday for their services. Besides
these there are several other instances: in
1763 the Rev. Theophilus Lindsey established
something like a Sunday-school at Catterick, in
Yorkshire; at High Wycombe, in 1769, Miss
Hannah Ball, a young Methodist lady, formed
a Sunday-school in her town; and at Macclesfield
that admirable and excellent man, the
Rev. David Simpson, originated a similar plan
<span class='pageno' id='Page_199'>199</span>of usefulness; and, contemporary with Mr.
Raikes, in the old Whitefield Tabernacle, at
Dursley, in Gloucestershire, we find Mr. William
King, a woollen card-maker, attempting the
work of teaching on a Sunday, and coming into
Gloucester to take counsel with Mr. Raikes as
to the best way of carrying it forward. Such,
scattered over the face of the country, at great
distances, and in no way representing a general
plan of useful labour, were the hints and efforts
before the idea took what may be called an
apostolic shape in the person of Robert Raikes.</p>

<p class='c007'>Notwithstanding the instances we have
given, Mr. Raikes must really be regarded
as the founder of Sunday-schools as an extended
organisation. With him they became more
than a notion, or a mere piece of local effort;
and his position and profession, and the high
respect in which he was held in the city in
which he lived, all alike enabled him to give
publicity to the plan: and before he commenced
this movement, he was known as a philanthropist;
indeed, John Howard himself bears
something like the same relation to prison
philanthropy which Raikes bears to Sunday-schools.
No one doubts that Howard was the
great apostle of prisons; but it seems that before
he commenced his great prison crusade,
Raikes had laboured diligently to reform the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_200'>200</span>Gloucester gaol. The condition of the prisoners
was most pitiable, and Raikes, nearly
twenty years before he commenced the Sunday-school
system, had been working among
them, attempting their material, moral, and
spiritual improvement, by which he had earned
for himself the designation of the “Teacher of
the Poor.” Howard visited Raikes in Gloucester,
and bears his testimony to the blessedness
and benevolence of his labours in the prison
there; and the gaol appears not unnaturally to
have suggested the idea of the Sunday-school
to the benevolent-hearted man. It was a
dreadful state of society. Some idea may be
formed of it from a paragraph in the <i>Gloucester
Journal</i> for June, 1783, the paper of which
Raikes was the editor and proprietor: it is mentioned
that no less than sixty-six persons were
committed to the Castle in one week, and Mr.
Raikes adds, “The prison is already so full
that all the gaoler’s stock of fetters is occupied,
and the smiths are hard at work casting new
ones.” He goes on to say: “The people sent
in are neither disappointed soldiers nor sailors,
but chiefly frequenters of ale-houses and skittle-alleys.”
Then, in another paragraph, he goes
on to remark, “The ships about to sail for
Botany Bay will carry about one thousand
miserable creatures, who might have lived perfectly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_201'>201</span>happy in this country had they been early
taught good principles, and to avoid the danger
of associating with those who make sobriety
and industry the objects of their ridicule.”</p>

<p class='c007'>From sentences like these it is easy to see the
direction in which the mind of the good man
was moving, before he commenced the work
which has given such a happy and abiding perpetuity
to his name. He gathered the children;
the streets were full of noise and disturbances
every Sunday. In a little while, says the
Rev. Dr. Glass, Mr. Raikes found himself surrounded
by such a set of little ragamuffins as
would have disgusted other men less zealous to
do good, and less earnest to disseminate comfort,
exhortation, and benefit to all around him,
than the founder of Sunday-schools. He prevented
their running about in wild disorder
through the streets. By and by, he arranged
that a number of them should meet him at
seven o’clock on the Sunday morning in the
cathedral close, when he and they all went
into the cathedral together to an early service.
The increase of the numbers was rapid; Mr.
Raikes was looked up to as the commander-in-chief
of this ragged regiment. It is testified
that a change took place and passed over the
streets of the old Gloucester city on the Sunday.
A glance at the features of Mr. Raikes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_202'>202</span>will assure the reader that he was an amiable
and gentle man, but that by no means implies
always a weak one. He appears to have had
plenty of strength, self-possession, and knowledge
of the world. He also belonged to, and
moved in, good society; and this is not without
its influence. As he told the King, in the
course of a long interview, when the King and
Queen sent for him to Windsor, to talk over
his system with him, in order that they might,
in some sense, be his disciples, and adopt and
recommend his plan: it was “botanising in
human nature.” “All that I require,” said
Raikes, to the parents of the children, “are
clean hands, clean faces, and their hair
combed.” To many who were barefooted,
after they had shown some regularity of attendance,
he gave shoes, and others he clothed.
Yes, it was “botanising in human nature;” and
very many anecdotes show what flowers sprang
up out of the black soil in the path of the good
man.</p>

<p class='c007'>All the stories told of Raikes show that the
law of kindness was usually on his lips. A
sulky, stubborn girl had resisted all reproofs
and correction, and had refused to ask forgiveness
of her mother. In the presence of the
mother, Raikes said to the girl, “Well, if you
have no regard for yourself, I have much for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_203'>203</span>you. You will be ruined and lost if you do not
become a good girl; and if you will not humble
yourself, I must humble myself on your behalf
and make a beginning for you;” and then, with
great solemnity, he entreated the mother to
forgive the girl, using such words that he overcame
the girl’s pride. The stubborn creature
actually fell on her knees, and begged her
mother’s forgiveness, and never gave Mr.
Raikes or her mother trouble afterwards. It is
a very simple anecdote; but it shows the Divine
spirit in the method of the man; and the more
closely we come into a personal knowledge of
his character, the more admirable and lovable
it seems. Thus literally true and beautiful are
the words of the hymn:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Like a lone husbandman, forlorn,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>The man of Gloucester went,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Bearing his seeds of precious corn;</div>
      <div class='line in2'>And God the blessing sent.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in1'>Now, watered long by faith and prayer,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>From year to year it grows,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Till heath, and hill, and desert bare,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Do blossom as the rose.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c016'>Mr. Raikes was a Churchman; he was so
happy as to have, near to his own parish of St.
Mary-le-Crypt, in Gloucester, an intimate
friend, the Rector of St. Aldate’s—a neighbouring
parish in the same city—the Rev.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_204'>204</span>Thomas Stock, whose monument in the
church truly testifies that “to him, in conjunction
with Robert Raikes, Esquire, is justly attributed
the honour of having planned and instituted
the first Sunday-school in the kingdom.”
Mr. Stock was but a young man in 1780, for he
died in 1803, then only fifty-four years of age;
he must have been, at the time of the first institution
of Sunday-schools, a young man of
fine and tender instincts. He appears, simultaneously
with Mr. Raikes’s movement, to have
formed a Sunday-school in his own parish,
taking upon himself the superintendence of it,
and the responsibility of such expenses as it involved.
But Mr. Stock says, in a letter written
in 1788, “The progress of the institution
through the kingdom is justly attributed to the
constant representations which Mr. Raikes
made in his own paper of the benefits which he
saw would probably arise from it.” At the time
Mr. Raikes began the work, he was about
forty-four years of age; it was a great thing in
that day to possess a respectable journal, a
newspaper of acknowledged character and influence;
to this, very likely, we owe it, in some
considerable measure, that the work in Gloucester
became extensively known and spread, and
expanded into a great movement. But he does
not appear to have used the columns of his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_207'>207</span>newspaper for the purpose of calling attention
to the usefulness and desirability of the work
until after it had been in operation about three
years; in 1783 and 1784, very modestly he
commends the system to general adoption.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<img src='images/i21-page-205-robertraikes.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic002'>
<p><span class='small'>Robert Raikes.</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>It is remarkable that in the course of two or
three years, several bishops—the Bishop of
Gloucester, in the cathedral, the Bishops of
Chester and Salisbury, in their charges to the
clergy of their dioceses—strongly commended
the plan. All orders of mind poured around
the movement their commendation; even Adam
Smith, whom no one will think likely to have
fallen into exaggerated expressions where
Christian activity is concerned, said, “No plan
has promised to effect a change of manners with
equal ease and simplicity, since the days of the
apostles.” The poet Cowper declared that he
knew of no nobler means by which a reformation
of the lower classes could be effected.
Some attempts have been made to claim for
John Wesley the honour of inaugurating the
Sunday-school system; considering the intensely
practical character of that venerated
man, and how much he was in advance of his
times in most of his activities, it is a wonder
that he did not; but his venerable memory has
honours, certainly, in all sufficiency. He wrote
his first commendation of Sunday-schools in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_208'>208</span>the <i>Arminian Magazine</i> of 1784. He says,
“I find these schools spring up wherever I
go; perhaps God may have a deeper end
therein than men are aware of; who knows but
that some of these schools may become nurseries
for Christians?” Prophetic as these words are,
this is fainter and tardier praise than we should
have expected from him; but in 1787 he writes
more warmly, expresses his belief that these
schools will be one great means of reviving
religion throughout the kingdom, and expresses
“wonder that Satan has not sent out some able
champion against them.” In 1788 he says: “I
verily think that these schools are one of the
noblest specimens of charity which have been
set on foot in England since the days of William
the Conqueror.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Some estimate may be formed of the rapidity
with which the movement spread, when we
find that in this year, 1787, the number of
children taught in Sunday-schools in Manchester
alone, on the testimony of the very
eminent John Nichols, the great printer and
anecdotist, was no fewer than five thousand.
It was in this year also, 1787, that Mr. Raikes
was visiting some relatives in the neighbourhood
of Windsor. He must have attained to
the dignity of a celebrity; nor is this wonderful,
when we remember the universal acceptance
<span class='pageno' id='Page_209'>209</span>with which his great idea of Sunday-schools
had been honoured. The Queen invited him to
visit her, and inquired of him, he says, “by
what accident a thought which promised so
much benefit to the lower order of people as
the institution of Sunday-schools, was suggested
to his mind?” The visit was a long one; he
spent two hours with the Queen—the King
also, we believe, being present most of the
time—not so much in expounding the system,
for that was simple enough, but they were
curious as to what he had observed in the
change and improvement of the characters
among whom he worked; and we believe that
it was then he told the King, in the words we
have already quoted, that he regarded his work
as a kind of “botanising in human nature;” this
was a favourite phrase of his in describing the
work. The result of this visit was, that the
Queen established a Sunday-school in Windsor,
and also a school of industry at Brentford,
which the King and Queen occasionally visited.
It may be taken as an illustration of the native
modesty of Mr. Raikes’s own character that he
never referred in his paper to this distinguished
notice of royalty.</p>

<p class='c007'>Do our readers know anything of Mrs. Sarah
Trimmer? A hundred years ago, there was,
probably, not a better-known woman in England;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_210'>210</span>and although her works have long ceased
to exercise any influence, we suppose none, in
her time, were more eminently useful. Pious,
devoted, earnestly evangelical, if we speak of
her as a kind of lesser Hannah More, the remark
must apply to her intellectual character rather
than to her reputation or her usefulness. Almost
as soon as the Sunday-school idea was
announced, she stepped forward as its most able
and intrepid advocate; her <i>Economy of Charity</i>
exercised a large influence, and she published a
number of books, which, at that time, were admirably
suited to the level of the capacity
which the Sunday-school teacher desired to
reach; she was also a great favourite with the
King and Queen, and appears to have visited
them on the easy terms of friendship. The intense
interest she felt in Sunday-schools is
manifest in innumerable pages of the two volumes
which record her life; certainly, she was
often at the ear of the royal pair, to whisper
any good and pleasant thing connected with the
progress of her favourite thought. She repeatedly
expresses her obligation to Mr. Raikes;
but her biographer only expresses the simple
truth when he says: “To Mr. Raikes, of
Gloucester, the nation is, in the first place, indebted
for the happy idea of collecting the
children of the poor together on the Sabbath,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_211'>211</span>and giving them instruction suited to the sacredness
of the day; but, perhaps, no publication
on this subject was of more utility than the
<i>Economy of Charity</i>. The influence of the
work was very visible when it first made its appearance,
and proved a source of unspeakable
gratification to the author.”</p>

<p class='c007'>It is not consistent with the aim of this book
to enter at greater length into the life of Robert
Raikes; we have said sufficient to show that
the term which has been applied to him of
“founder of Sunday-schools,” is not misapplied.
He was a simple and good man, on whose heart,
as into a fruitful soil, an idea fell, and it became
a realised conviction. Look at his portrait,
and instantly there comes to your mind
Cowper’s well-known description of one of his
friends,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“An honest man, close-buttoned to the chin,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Broadcloth without, and a warm heart within.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c018'>No words can better describe him—not a tint
of fanaticism seems to shade his character; he
had a warm enthusiasm for ends and aims
which commended themselves to his judgment.
It is pleasant to know that, as he lived when
the agitation for the abolition of the slave trade
was commencing, he gave to the movement his
hearty blessings and best wishes. At sixty-seven
<span class='pageno' id='Page_212'>212</span>years of age he retired from business; no
doubt a very well-to-do man, for he was the
owner of two freehold estates near Gloucester,
and he received an annuity of three hundred
pounds from the <i>Gloucester Journal</i>. He died
at his house in Bell Lane, in the city of Gloucester,
where he had taken up his residence
when he retired from active life; he died suddenly,
in his seventy-sixth year, in 1811. Then
the family vault in St. Mary-le-Crypt, which
sixty years before had received his father’s
ashes, received the body of the gentle philanthropist.
He had kept up his Sunday-school
work and interest to the close; and he left instructions
that his Sunday-school children
should be invited to follow him to the grave,
and that each of them should receive a shilling
and a plum cake. On the tablet over the place
where he sleeps an appropriate verse of Scripture
well describes him: “When the ear heard
me, then it blessed me; and when the eye saw
me, it gave witness to me: because I delivered
the poor that cried, and the fatherless, and
him that had none to help him. The blessing
of him that was ready to perish came upon
me: and I caused the widow’s heart to sing for
joy.”</p>
<p class='c007'>It seems very questionable whether the
slightest shade can cross the memory of this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_213'>213</span>plain, simply useful, and unostentatious man.
And it ought to be said that Anne Raikes, who
rests in the same grave, appears to have been
every way the worthy companion of her husband.
She was the daughter of Thomas Trigg,
Esq., of Newnham, in Gloucestershire; the
sister of Sir Thomas Trigg and Admiral John
Trigg. They were married in 1767. She shared
in all her husband’s large and charitable intentions,
and when he died he left the whole of his
property to her. She survived him seventeen
years, and died in 1828, at the age of eighty-five.</p>

<p><span class='small'>RAIKES’S HOUSE, GLOUCESTER.</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The visitor to Gloucester will be surely struck
<span class='pageno' id='Page_214'>214</span>by a quaint old house in Southgate Street—still
standing almost unaltered, save that the
basement is now divided into two shops. A
few years since the old oak timbers were
braced, stained, and varnished. It is a fine
specimen of the better class of English residences
of a hundred and fifty years since, and is
still remarkable in the old city, owing very
much to the good taste which governed their
renovation. This was the printing-office of
Robert Raikes, a notice in the <i>Gloucester
Journal</i>, dated August 19, 1758, announcing his
removal from Blackfriars Square to this house in
Southgate Street. The house now is in the
occupation of Mrs. Watson. The house where
Raikes lived and died is nearly opposite. It
will not be difficult for the spectator to realise
the pleasant image of the old gentleman,
dressed, after the fashion of the day, in his blue
coat with gold buttons, buff waistcoat, drab
kerseymere breeches, white stockings, and low
shoes, passing beneath those ancient gables,
and engaged in those various public and private
duties which we have attempted to record. A
century has passed away since then, and the
simple lessons the philanthropist attempted to
impart to the young waifs and strays he gathered
about him have expanded into more comprehensive
departments of knowledge. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_215'>215</span>originator of Sunday-schools would be astonished
were he to step into almost any of those
which have branched out from his leading idea.
It is still expanding; it is one of the most real
and intense activities of the Universal Church;
but among the immense crowds of those who,
in England and America, are conducting Sunday-school
classes, it is, perhaps, not too much
to say, that in not one is there a more simple
and earnest desire to do good than that which
illuminated the life, and lends a sweet and
charming interest to the memory, of Robert
Raikes.</p>

  <h2 id='ch11' class='c004'>CHAPTER XI<br /> <br /><span class='small'>THE ROMANTIC STORY OF SILAS TOLD.</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c006'>Dr. Abel Stevens, in his <i>History of Methodism</i>,
says, “I congratulate myself on the
opportunity of reviving the memory of Silas
Told;” and speaks of the little biography in
which Silas himself records his adventures as
“a record told with frank and affecting simplicity,
in a style of terse and flowing English Defoe
might have envied.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Such a testimony is well calculated to excite
the curiosity of an interested reader, especially
as the two or three incidents mentioned only
serve to whet the appetite for more of the like
description. The little volume to which he refers
has been for some years in the possession
of the author of this volume. It is indeed an
astonishing book; its alleged likeness to Defoe’s
charmingly various style of recital of adventures
by sea and by land is no exaggeration,
whilst as a piece of real biography it may
claim, and quite sustain, a place side by side
with the romantic and adventurous career of
John Newton; but the wild wonderfulness of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_217'>217</span>the story of Silas seems to leave Newton’s in
the shade. Like Newton, Told was also a seer
of visions and a dreamer of dreams, and a believer,
in special providences; and well might he
believe in such who was led certainly along as
singular a path as any mortal could tread. The
only other memorial besides his own which has,
we believe, been penned of him—a brief recapitulations-well
describes him as honest, simple,
and tender. Silas Told accompanied, in that
awful day, numbers of persons to the gallows,
and attempted to console sufferers and victims
in circumstances of most harrowing and tragic
solemnity: he certainly furnished comfortable
help and light when no others were willing or
able to sympathise or to help. John Wesley
loved him, and when Silas died he buried him,
and says of him in his <i>Journal</i>: “On the 20th
of December, 1778, I buried what was mortal of
honest Silas Told. For many years he attended
the malefactors in Newgate without fee or
reward; and I suppose no man, for this hundred
years, has been so successful in that melancholy
office. God had given him peculiar talents for
it, and he had amazing success therein; the
greatest part of those whom he attended died
in peace, and many of them in the triumph of
faith.” Such was Silas Told.</p>

<p class='c007'>But before we come to those characteristic
<span class='pageno' id='Page_218'>218</span>circumstances to which Wesley refers, we must
follow him through some of the wild scenes of
his sailor life. He was born in Bristol in 1711; his
parents were respectable and creditable people,
but of somewhat faded families. His grandfather
had been an eminent physician in Bunhill
Row, London; his mother was from Exeter.
* * *</p>

<p class='c007'>Silas was educated in the noble foundation
school of Edward Colston in Bristol. The life
of this excellent philanthropist was so remarkable,
and in many particulars so like his own,
that we cannot wonder that he stops for some
pages in his early story to recite some of the
remarkable phenomena in Colston’s life. Silas’s
childhood was singular, and the stories he tells
are especially noticeable, because in after-life
the turn of his character seems to have been
especially real and practical. Thus he tells
how, when a child, wandering with his sister in
the King’s Wood, near Bristol, they lost their
way, and were filled with the utmost consternation,
when suddenly, although no house was
in view, nor, as they thought, near, a dog came
up behind them, and drove them clear out of
the wood into a path with which they were acquainted;
especially it was remarkable that the
dog never barked at them, but when they
looked round about for the dog he was nowhere
<span class='pageno' id='Page_219'>219</span>to be seen. Careless children out for their own
pleasure, they sauntered on their way again,
and again lost their way in the wood—were
again bewildered, and in greater perplexity
than before, when, on a sudden looking up, they
saw the same dog making towards them; they
ran from him in fright, but he followed them,
drove them out of the labyrinths, and did not
leave them until they could not possibly lose
their way again. Simple Silas says, “I then
turned about to look for the dog, but saw no
more of him, although we were now upon an
open common. This was the Lord’s doings,
and marvellous in our eyes.”</p>

<p class='c007'>When he was twelve years of age, he appears
to have been quite singularly influenced by the
reading of the <i>Pilgrim’s Progress</i>; and late in
life, when writing his biography, he briefly, but
significantly, attempts to reproduce the intense
enjoyment he received—the book evidently
caught and coloured his whole imagination. At
this time, too, he was very nearly drowned,
and while drowning, so far from having any
sense of terror, he had no sense nor idea of the
things of this world, but that it appeared to
him he rushingly emerged out of thick darkness
into what appeared to him a glorious city,
lustrous and brilliant, the light of which seemed
to illuminate the darkness through which he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_220'>220</span>had urged his way. It was as if the city had a
floor like glass, and yet he was sure that neither
city nor floor had any substance; also he saw
people there; the inhabitants arrayed in robes
of what seemed the finest substance, but flowing
from their necks to their feet; and yet he
was sensible too that they had no material
substance; they moved, but did not labour as
in walking, but glided as if carried along by the
wind; and he testifies how he felt a wonderful
joy and peace, and he never forgot the impression
through life, although soon recalled to the
world in which he was to sorrow and suffer so
much. It is quite easy to see John Bunyan in
all this; but while he was thus pleasantly happy
in his visionary or intro-visionary state, a
benevolent and tender-hearted Dutchman, who
had been among some haymakers in a field on
the banks of the river, was striking out after
him among the willow-bushes and sedges of
the stream, from whence he was brought, body
and soul, back to the world again. Such are
the glimpses of the childhood of Silas.</p>

<p class='c007'>Then shortly comes a dismal transition from
strange providences in the wood, and enchanting
visions beneath the waves, to the
singularly severe sufferings of a seafaring life.
The ships in that day have left a grim and ugly
reputation surviving still.  The term “sea-devil”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_221'>221</span>has often been used as descriptive of the
masters of ships in that time. Silas seems to
have sailed under some of the worst specimens
of this order. About the age of fourteen he was
bound apprentice to Captain Moses Lilly, and
started for his first voyage from Bristol to Jamaica.
“Here,” he says, “I may date my first
sufferings.” He says the first of his afflictions
“was sea-sickness, which held me till my arrival
in Jamaica;” and considering that it was a
voyage of fourteen weeks, it was a fair spell of
entertainment from that pleasant companion.
They were short of water, they were put on
short allowance of food, and when having obtained
their freight, while lying in Kingston
harbour, their vessel, and seventy-six sail of
ships, many of them very large, but all riding
with three anchors ahead, were all scattered by
an astonishing hurricane, and all the vessels in
Port Royal shared the same fate. He tells how
the corpses of the drowned sailors strewed the
shores, and how, immediately after the subsidence
of the hurricane, a pestilential sickness
swept away thousands of the natives. “Every
morning,” he says, “I have observed between
thirty and forty corpses carried past my window;
being very near death myself, I expected
every day to approach with the messenger of
my dissolution.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_222'>222</span>During this time he appears to have been
lying in a warehouse, with no person to take
care of him except a negro, who every day
brought to him, where he was laid in his hammock,
Jesuit’s bark.</p>

<p class='c007'>“At length,” he says, “my master gave me
up, and I wandered up and down the town,
almost parched with the insufferable blaze of
the sun, till I resolved to lay me down and die,
as I had neither money nor friend; accordingly,
I fixed upon a dunghill in the east end of the
town of Kingston, and being in such a weak
condition, I pondered much upon Job’s case,
and considered mine similar to that of his;
however, I was fully resigned to death, nor had
I the slightest expectation of relief from any
quarter; yet the kind providence of God was
over me, and raised me up a friend in an entire
stranger. A London captain coming by was
struck with the sordid object, came up to me,
and, in a very compassionate manner, asked
me if I was sensible of any friend upon the island
from whom I could obtain relief; he likewise
asked me to whom I belonged. I answered, to
Captain Moses Lilly, and had been cast away
in the late hurricane. This captain appeared
to have some knowledge of my master, and,
cursing him for a barbarous villain, told me he
would compel him to take proper care of me.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_223'>223</span>About a quarter of an hour after this, my master
arrived, whom I had not seen before for six
weeks, and took me to a public-house kept by,
a Mrs. Hutchinson, and there ordered me to be
taken proper care of. However, he soon quitted
the island, and directed his course for England,
leaving me behind at his sick quarters; and, if
it should please God to permit my recovery, I
was commanded to take my passage to England
in the <i>Montserrat</i>, Captain David Jones, a
very fatherly, tender-hearted man: this was
the first alleviation of my misery. Now the
captain sent his son on shore, in order to receive
me on board. When I came alongside, Captain
Jones, standing on the ship’s gunwale, addressed
me after a very humane and compassionate
manner, with expressions to the following
effect: ‘Come, poor child, into the cabin, and
you shall want nothing that the ship affords;
go, and my son shall prepare for you, in the
first place, a basin of good egg-flip, and anything
else that maybe conducive to your relief.’
But I, being very bad with my fever and ague,
could neither eat nor drink.”</p>

<p class='c007'>A very pleasant captain, this seems, to have
sailed with; but poor Silas had very little of
his company. However, the good captain and
his boatswain put their experiences together,
and the poor boy was restored to health, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_224'>224</span>after some singular adventures he reached
Bristol. Arriving there, however, Captain
Lilly transferred him to a Captain Timothy
Tucker, of whom Silas bears the pleasing testimony,
“A greater villain, I firmly believe,
never existed, although at home he assumed
the character and temper of a saint.” The
wretch actually stole a white woman from her
own country to sell her to the black prince of
Bonny, on the African coast. They had not
been long at sea before this delightful person
gave Silas a taste of his temper. Thinking the
boy had taken too much bread from the cask,
he went to the cabin and brought back with
him his large horsewhip, “and exercised it,”
says Silas, “about my body in so unmerciful a
manner, that not only the clothes on my back
were cut to pieces, but every sailor declared
they could see my bones; and then he threw
me all along the deck, and jumped many times
upon the pit of my stomach, in order to endanger
my life; and had not the people laid
hold of my two legs, and thrown me under the
windlass, after the manner they throw dead
cats or dogs, he would have ended his despotic
cruelty in murder.” This free and easy mode
of recreation was much indulged in by seafaring
officers in that time, but this Tucker appears to
have been really what Silas calls him, “a blood-thirsty
<span class='pageno' id='Page_225'>225</span>devil;” and stories of murder, and the
incredible cruelties of the slave-trade lend their
horrible fascination to the narrative of Silas Told.
How would it be possible to work the commerce
of the slave-trade without such characters
as this Tucker, who presents much more the
appearance of a lawless pirate than of the noble
character we call a sailor?</p>

<p class='c007'>Those readers who would like to follow poor
Silas through the entire details of his miseries
on ship-board, his hairbreadth escapes from
peril and shipwreck, must read them in Silas’s
own book, if they can find it; but we may attempt
to give some little account of his wreck
upon the American coast, in New England.
Few stories can be more charming than the
picture he gives of his wanderings with his
companions after their escape from the wreck,
not because he and they were destitute, and
all but naked, but because of the pleasant
glimpses we have of the simple, hospitable,
home life in those beautiful old New England
days—hospitality of the most romantic and
free-handed description.</p>

<p class='c007'>We will select two pictures, as illustrating
something of the character of New England
settlements in those very early days of their
history. Silas and his companions were cast
on shore, and had found refuge in a tavern
<span class='pageno' id='Page_226'>226</span>seven miles from the beach; he had no clothing;
but the landlord of the tavern gave him a
pair of red breeches, the last he had after supplying
the rest. Silas goes on: “Ebenezer
Allen, Governor of the island, and who dwelt
about six miles from the tavern, hearing of our
distress, made all possible haste to relieve us;
and when he arrived at the tavern, accompanied
by his two eldest sons, he took Captain
Seaborn, his black servant, Joseph and myself
through partiality, and escorted us home to his
own house. Between eleven and twelve at
night we reached the Governor’s mansion, all
of us ashamed to be seen; we would fain have
hid ourselves in any dark hole or corner, as it
was a truly magnificent building, with wings
on each side thereof, but, to our astonishment,
we were received into the great parlour, where
were sitting by the fireside two fine, portly
ladies, attending the spit, which was burdened
with a very heavy quarter of house-lamb. Observing
a large mahogany table to be spread
with a fine damask cloth, and every knife, fork,
and plate to be laid in a genteel mode, I was
apprehensive that it was intended for the entertainment
of some persons of note or distinction,
or, at least, for a family supper. In a
short time the joint was taken up, and laid on
the table, yet nobody sat down to eat; and as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_227'>227</span>we were almost hid in one corner of the room,
the ladies turned round and said, ‘Poor men,
why don’t you come to supper?’ I replied,
‘Madam, we had no idea it was prepared for
us.’ The ladies then entreated us to eat without
any fear of them, assuring us that it was
prepared for none others; and none of us having
eaten anything for near six and thirty
hours before, we picked the bones of the whole
quarter, to which we had plenty of rich old
cider to drink: after supper we went to bed,
and enjoyed so profound a sleep that the next
morning it was difficult for the old gentleman
to awake us. The following day I became the
partaker of several second-hand garments, and,
as I was happily possessed of a little learning,
it caused me to be more abundantly caressed
by the whole family, and therefore I fared
sumptuously every day.</p>

<p class='c007'>“This unexpected change of circumstances
and diet I undoubtedly experienced in a very
uncommon manner; but as I was strictly trained
up a Churchman, I could not support the idea
of a Dissenter, although, God knows, I had
well-nigh by this time dissented from all that is
truly good. This proved a bar to my promotion,
and my strong propensity to sail for England
to see my mother prevented my acceptance
of the greatest offer I ever received in my life
<span class='pageno' id='Page_228'>228</span>before; for when the day came that we were to
quit the island, and to cross the sound over to
a town called Sandwich, on the main continent,
the young esquire took me apart from my associates,
and earnestly entreated me to tarry with
them, saying that if I would accede to their
proposals nothing should be lacking to render
my situation equivalent to the rest of the family.
As there were very few white men on the
island, I was fixed upon, if willing, to espouse
one of the Governor’s daughters. I had been
informed that the Governor was immensely rich,
having on the island two thousand head of cattle
and twenty thousand sheep, and every acre
of land thereon belonging to himself. However,
I could not be prevailed upon to accept the
offer; therefore the Governor furnished us with
forty shillings each, and gave us a pass over to
the town of Sandwich.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Such passages as this show the severe experiences
through which Silas passed; they illustrate
the education he was receiving for that
life of singular earnestness and tenderness which
was to close and crown his career; but we have
made the extract here for the purpose of giving
some idea of that cheerful, hospitable, home
life of New England in those then almost wild
regions which are now covered with the population
of towns.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_229'>229</span>Here is another instance, which occurred at
Hanover, in the United States, through which
district Silas and his companions appear to have
been wending their way, seeking a return to
England. “One Sunday, as my companions
and self were crossing the churchyard at the
time of Divine service, a well-dressed gentleman
came out of the church and said, ‘Gentlemen,
we do not suffer any person in this country
to travel on the Lord’s day.’ We gave him to
understand that it was necessity which constrained
us to walk that way, as we had all been
shipwrecked on St. Martin’s [Martha’s (?)]
Vineyard, and were journeying to Boston. The
gentleman was still dissatisfied, but quitted our
company and went into church. When we had
gone a little farther, a large white house proved
the object of our attention. The door being
wide open, we reasonably imagined it was not
in an unguarded state, without servants or
others; but as we all went into the kitchen, nobody
appeared to be within, nor was there an
individual either above or below. However, I
advised my companions to tarry in the house
until some person or other should arrive. They
did so, and in a short time afterwards two ladies,
richly dressed, with a footman following
them, came in through the kitchen; and, notwithstanding
they turned round and saw us,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_230'>230</span>who in so dirty and disagreeable a garb and appearance
might have terrified them exceedingly,
yet neither of them was observed to take
any notice of us, nor did either of them ask us
any questions touching the cause of so great an
intrusion.</p>

<p class='c007'>“About a quarter of an hour afterwards, a
footman entered the kitchen with a cloth and
a large two-quart silver tankard full of rich
cider, also a loaf and cheese; but we, not
knowing it was prepared for us, did not attempt
to partake thereof. At length the ladies
coming into the kitchen, and viewing us in our
former position, desired to know the reason of
our malady, seeing we were not refreshing ourselves;
whereupon I urged the others to join
with me in the acceptance of so hospitable a
proposal. After this the ladies commenced a
similar inquiry into our situation. I gave them
as particular an account of every recent vicissitude
that befell us as I was capable of, with a
genuine, relation of our being shipwrecked, and
the sole reasons of our travelling into that
country; likewise begged that they would excuse
our impertinence, as they were already informed
of the cause; we were then emboldened
to ask the ladies if they could furnish us with a
lodging that evening. They replied it was
uncertain whether our wishes could be accomplished
<span class='pageno' id='Page_231'>231</span>there, but that if we proceeded somewhat
farther we should doubtless be entertained
and genteelly accommodated by their
brother—a Quaker—whose house was not more
than a distance of seven miles. We thanked
the ladies, and set forward, and at about eight
o’clock arrived at their brother’s house. Fatigued
with our journey, we hastened into the
parlour and delivered our message; whereupon
a gentleman gave us to understand, by his free
and liberal conduct, that he was the Quaker
referred to by the aforesaid ladies, who, total
strangers as we were, used us with a degree of
hospitality impossible to be exceeded; indeed,
I could venture to say that the accommodations
we met with at the Quaker’s house, seeing
they were imparted to us with such affectionate
sympathy, greatly outweighed those
we formerly experienced.</p>

<p class='c007'>“After our banquet, the gentleman took us
up into a fine spacious bed-chamber, with desirable
bedding and very costly chintz curtains.
We enjoyed a sound night’s rest, and arose between
seven and eight the next morning, and
were entertained with a good breakfast;
returned many thanks for the unrestrained
friendship and liberality, and departed therefrom,
fully purposed to direct our course for
Boston, which was not more than seven miles
<span class='pageno' id='Page_232'>232</span>farther. Here all the land was strewed with
plenty, the orchards were replete with apple-trees
and pears; they had cider-presses in the
centre of their orchards, and great quantities
of fine cider, and any person might become a
partaker thereof for the mere trouble of asking.
We soon entered Boston, a commodious, beautiful
city, with seventeen spired meetings, the
dissenting religion being then established in
that part of the world. I resided here for the
space of four months, and lodged with Captain
Seaborn at Deacon Townshend’s; deacon of the
North Meeting, and by trade a blacksmith.”
He gives a glowing and beautiful description of
the high moral and religious character of Boston;
here also he met with a stroke of good
fortune in receiving some arrears of salvage for
a vessel he had assisted in saving before his last
wreck. Such are specimens of the interest and
entertainment afforded in the earlier parts of
this pleasant piece of autobiography. But we
must hasten past his adventures, both in the
island of Antigua and among the islands of the
Mediterranean.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is not wonderful that the great sufferings
and toils of Silas should, even at a very early
period of life, prostrate his health, and subject
him to repeated vehement attacks of illness.
He was but twenty-three when he married;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_233'>233</span>still, however, a sailor, and destined yet for
some wild experiences on the seas. Not long,
however. A married life disposed him for a
home life, and he accepted, while still a very
young man, the position of a schoolmaster, beneath
the patronage of a Lady Luther, in the
county of Essex. He was not in this position
very long. Silas, although an unconverted
man, must have had strong religious feelings;
and the clergyman of the parish, fond of smoking
and drinking with him—and it may well be
conceived what an entertaining companion
Silas must have been in those days, with his
budget of adventures—ridiculed him for his
faith in the Scriptures and his belief in Bible
theology. This so shocked Silas, that, making
no special profession of religion, he yet separated
himself from the clergyman’s company,
and shortly after he left that neighbourhood,
and again sought his fortune, but without any
very cheerful prospects, in London.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was in 1740 that a young blacksmith introduced
him to the people whom he had hitherto
hated and despised—the Methodists. He heard
John Wesley preach at the Foundry in the
Moor Fields from the text, “I write unto you,
little children, for your sins are forgiven you.”
This set his soul on fire; he became a Methodist,
notwithstanding the very vehement opposition
<span class='pageno' id='Page_234'>234</span>of his wife, to whom he appears to have
been very tenderly attached, and who herself
was a very motherly and virtuous woman, but
altogether indisposed to the new notions, as
many people considered them. He improved
in circumstances, and became a responsible
managing clerk on a wharf at Wapping. While
there Mr. Wesley repeatedly and earnestly
pressed him to take charge of the charity school
he had established at the Foundry. After long
hesitation he did so; and it was here that while
attending a service at five o’clock in the morning,
he heard Mr. Wesley preach from the text,
“I was sick, and in prison, and ye visited me
not.” By a most remarkable application of this
charge to himself, Silas testifies that his mind
was stirred with a strange compunction, as he
thought that he had never cared for, or attempted
to ameliorate the condition, or to minister
to the souls of the crowds of those unhappy
malefactors who then almost weekly expiated
their offences, very often of the most trivial
description, on the gallows. It seems that the
hearing that sermon proved to be a most
remarkable turning-point in the life of Silas.
Through it he became most eminently useful
during a very remarkable and painful career;
and his after-life is surrounded by such a succession
of romantic incidents that they at once
<span class='pageno' id='Page_235'>235</span>equal, if they do not transcend, and strangely
contrast with his wild adventures on the seas.</p>

<p class='c007'>And here we may pause a moment to reflect
how every man’s work derives its character from
what he was before. What thousands of sailors,
in that day, passed through all the trials which
Silas passed, leaving them still only rough
sailor men! In him all the roughness seemed
only to strike down to depths of wonderful
compassion and tenderness. Singular was the
university in which he graduated to become so
great and powerful a preacher! How he preached
we do not know, but his words must have been
warm and touching, faithful and loving, judging
from their results; and as to his pulpit, we do
not hear that it was in chapels or churches—his
audience was very much confined to the
condemned cell, and to the cart from whence
the poor victims were “turned off,” as it was
called in those days. In this work he found
his singular niche. How long it often takes for
a man to find his place in the work that is
given him to do; and when the place is found,
sometimes, how long it takes to fit nicely and
admirably into the work itself! what sharp
angles have, to be rubbed away, what difficulties
to be overcome! It is wonderful, with all the
horrible experiences through which this man
had passed, and spectacles of cruelty so revolting
<span class='pageno' id='Page_236'>236</span>that they seem almost to shake our faith,
not merely in man, but even in a just and overruling
God, that every sentiment of religion
and tenderness had not been eradicated from
his nature; but it would appear that the old
gracious influences of childhood—the days of
the <i>Pilgrim’s Progress</i>, and the wonderful
vision when drowning beneath the waters, had
never been effaced through all his strange and
chequered career, although certainly not untainted
by the sins of the ordinary sailor’s life.
The work in which he was now to be engaged
needed a very tender and affectionate nature;
but ordinary tenderness starts back and is
repelled by cruel and repulsive scenes. Told’s
education on the seas, like that of a surgeon in
a hospital, enabled him to look on harrowing
sights of suffering without wincing, or losing in
his tender interest his own self-possession.</p>

<p class='c007'>It ought not to be forgotten that John Howard,
the great prison philanthropist, belongs to
the epoch of the Great Revival. Of him
Edmund Burke said, “He had visited all
Europe in a circumnavigation of charity, not to
survey the sumptuousness of palaces, or the
stateliness of temples; not to collect medals or
to collate manuscripts, but to dive into the
depths of dungeons and to plunge into the infections
of hospitals.” About the year 1760,<a id='r13' /><a href='#f13' class='c012'><b>[13]</b></a>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_237'>237</span>when he began his consecrated work, Silas Told,
as a prison philanthropist upon a smaller, but
equally earnest scale, attempted to console the
prisoners of Newgate.</p>

<div class='footnote c013' id='f13'>
<p class='c014'><span class='label'><a href='#r13'>13</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>See <a href='#p-236'>Appendix</a>.</p>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Shortly after hearing that sermon to which
we have alluded, a messenger came to him at
the school to tell him that there were ten
malefactors lying under sentence of death in
Newgate, some of them in a state of considerable
terror and alarm, and imploring him to
find some one to visit them. Here was the call
to the work. The coincidences were remarkable:
John Wesley’s sermon, his own aroused
and tender state of mind produced by the
sermon, and the occasion for the active and
practical exercise of his feeling. So opportunities
would meet us of turning suggestions into
usefulness, if we watched for them.</p>

<p class='c007'>The English laws were barbarous in those
days; truly it has been said that a fearfully
heavyweight of blood rests upon the conscience
of England for the state of the law in those
times. Few of those who have given such
honour to the noble labours of John Howard
and the loving ministrations of Elizabeth Fry
ever heard of Silas Told. In a smaller sphere
than the first of these, and in a much more intensely
painful manner than the second, he
anticipated the labours of both. He instantly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_238'>238</span>responded to this first call to Newgate. Two
of the ten malefactors were reprieved; he
attended the remaining eight to the gallows.
He had so influenced the hearts of all of them
in their cell that their obduracy was broken
down and softened—so great had been his
power over them, that locked up together in
one cell the night before their execution, they
had spent it in prayer and solemn conversation.
“At length they were ordered into the cart,
and I was prevailed upon to go with them.
When we were in the cart I addressed myself
to each of them separately. The first was Mr.
Atkins, the son of a glazier in the city, a youth
nineteen years of age. I said to him, ‘My dear,
are you afraid to die?’ He said, ‘No, sir;
really I am not.’ I asked him wherefore he was
not afraid to die? and he said, ‘I have laid my
soul at the feet of Jesus, therefore I am not
afraid to die.’ I then spake to Mr. Gardner, a
journeyman carpenter; he made a very comfortable
report of the true peace of God which he
found reigning in his heart. The last person
to whom I spoke was one Thompson, a very
illiterate young man; but he assured me he was
perfectly happy in his Saviour, and continued
so until his last moments. This was the first
time of my visiting the malefactors in Newgate,
and then it was not without much shame and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_239'>239</span>fear, because I clearly perceived the greater part
of the populace considered me as one of the
sufferers.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The most remarkable of this cluster was one
John Lancaster—for what offence he was sentenced
to death does not appear; but the entire
account Silas gives of him, both in the prison
and at the place of execution, exhibits a fine,
tender, and really holy character. The attendant
sheriff himself burst into tears before the
beautiful demeanour of this young man. However,
so it was, that he was without any friend
in London to procure for his body a proper
interment; and the story of Silas admits us
into a pretty spectacle of the times. After the
poor bodies were cut down, Lancaster’s was
seized by a surgeons’ mob, who intended to
carry it over to Paddington. It was Silas’s first
experience, as we have seen; and he describes
the whole scene as rather like a great fair than
an awful execution. In this confusion the body
of Lancaster had been seized, the crowd dispersed—all
save some old woman, who sold
gin, and Silas himself, very likely smitten into
extraordinary meditation by a spectacle so new
to him—when a company of eight sailors appeared
on the scene, with truncheons in their
hands, who said they had come to see the execution,
and gazed with very menacing faces
<span class='pageno' id='Page_240'>240</span>on the vacated gallows from whence the bodies
had been cut down. “Gentlemen,” said the
old woman, “I suppose you want the man that
the surgeons have got?” “Ay,” said the sailors,
“where is he?” The old woman gave them to
understand that the body had been carried
away to Paddington, and she pointed them to
the direct road. Away the sailors hastened—it
may be presumed that Lancaster was a
sailor, and some old comrade of these men.
They demanded his body from the surgeons’
mob, and obtained it. What they intended to
do with it scarcely transpires; it is most likely
that they had intended a rescue at the foot of
the gallows, and arrived too late. However,
hoisting it on their shoulders, away they
marched with it off to Islington, and thence
round to Shoreditch; thence to a place called
Coventry’s Fields. By this time they were
getting fairly wearied out with their burden,
and by unanimous consent they agreed to lay
it on the step of the first door they came to:
this done, they started off. It created some
stir in the street, which brought down an old
woman who lived in the house to the step of the
door, and who exclaimed, as she saw the body,
in a loud, agitated voice, “Lord! this is my son
John Lancaster!” It is probable that the old
woman was a Methodist, for to Silas Told and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_241'>241</span>the Methodists she was indebted for a decent and
respectable burial for her son in a good strong
coffin and decent shroud. Silas and his wife
went to see him whilst he was lying so, previous
to his burial. There was no alteration of
his visage, no marks of violence, and says Told,
“A pleasant smile appeared on his countenance,
and he lay as in sweet sleep.” A singularly
romantic story, for it seems the sailors did
not know at all to whom he belonged; and
what an insight into the social condition of
London at that time!</p>

<p class='c007'>Told did not give up his connection with his
school at the Foundry, but he devoted himself,
sanctioned by John Wesley and his Church
fellowship, to the preaching and ministering to
all the poor felons and malefactors in London,
including also, in this exercise of love, the
work-houses for twelve miles round London; he
believed he had a message of tender sympathy
for those who were of this order, “sick and in
prison.” It seems strange to us, who know how
much he had suffered himself, that the old
sailor possessed such a loving, tender, and
affectionate heart; and yet he tells how, in the
earlier part of these very years, he was haunted
by irritating doubts and alarms: then came to
him old mystical revelations, such as those he
had known when drowning, reminding us of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_242'>242</span>similar instances in the lives of John Howe and
John Flavel; and the noble man was strengthened.</p>

<p class='c007'>He went on for twenty years in the way we
have described; and the interest of his autobiography
compels the wish that it were much
longer; for, of course, the largest amount of his
precious life of labour was not set down, and
cannot be recalled; and readers who are fond
of romance will find his name in connection
with some of the most remarkable executions
of his time.</p>

<p class='c007'>A singular circumstance was this: Four
gentlemen—Mr. Brett, the son of an eminent
divine in Dublin; Whalley, a gentleman of considerable
fortune, possessed of three country-seats
of his own; Dupree, “in every particular,”
says Silas, “a complete gentleman;” and Morgan,
an officer on board one of His Majesty’s
ships of war—after dinner, upon the occasion of
their being at an election for the members for
Chelmsford, proposed to start forth, and, by
way of recreation, rob somebody on the highway.
Away they went, and chanced upon a
farmer, whom they eased of a considerable sum
of money. The farmer followed them into
Chelmsford; they were all secured, and next
day removed to London; they took their trials,
and were sentenced, and left for execution.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_243'>243</span>Told visited them all in prison. Morgan was
engaged to be married to Lady Elizabeth Hamilton,
the sister of the Duke of Hamilton. She
repeatedly visited her affianced husband in the
cell, and Told was with them at most of their
interviews. It was supposed that, from the
rank of the prisoners, and the character of their
offence, there would be no difficulty in obtaining
a reprieve; but the King was quite inexorable;
he said, “his subjects were not to be in
bodily fear in order that men might gratify
their drunken whims.” Lady Elizabeth Hamilton,
however, thrust herself several times before
the King; wept, threw herself on her
knees, and behaved altogether in such a manner
that the King said, “Lady Betsy, there is
no standing your importunity any further; I
will spare his life, but on one condition—that
he is not acquainted therewith until he arrives
at the place of execution;” and it was so. The
other three unfortunates were executed, and
Lady Elizabeth, in her coach, received her
lover into it as he stepped from the cart. It is
a sad story, but it must have been a sweet satisfaction
to the lady.</p>

<p class='c007'>Far more dreadful were some cases which
engaged the tender heart of Silas. A young
man, named Coleman, was tried for an aggravated
assault on a young woman. The young
<span class='pageno' id='Page_244'>244</span>woman herself declared that Coleman was not
the man; but he had enemies who pressed apparent
circumstances against him, and urged
them on the young woman, to induce her to
change her opinion. She never wavered; yet,
singular to say, he was convicted and executed.
A short time after the real criminal was discovered,
by his own confession; he was also
tried, condemned, and executed, and the perjured
witnesses against poor Coleman sentenced
to stand in the pillory.</p>

<p class='c007'>But one of the most pitiful and dreadful cases
in Silas Told’s experience was that of Mary
Edmondson, a sweet young girl, tried upon
mere circumstantial evidence, and executed
on Kennington Common, for the supposed
murder of her aunt at Rotherhithe. She appears
to have been most brutally treated; the
mob believed her to be guilty, and received
her with shocking execrations. Whether Silas
had a prejudice against her or not, we cannot
say; it is not likely that he had a prejudice
against any suffering soul; but it so happened,
he says, as he had not visited her in her imprisonment,
so he entertained no idea of seeing her
suffer. But as he was passing through the
Borough, a pious cheesemonger, named Skinner,
called him into his shop, tenderly expressed
deep interest in her present and future
<span class='pageno' id='Page_245'>245</span>state, and besought him to see her; so his first
interview with her was only just as she was
going forth to her sad end.</p>

<p class='c007'>Silas shall tell the story himself: “When
she was brought into the room, she stood with
her back against the wainscot, but appeared
perfectly resigned to the will of God. I then
addressed myself to her, saying, ‘My dear, for
God’s sake, for Christ’s sake, for the sake of
your own precious soul, do not die with a lie in
your mouth; you are, in a few moments, to appear
in the presence of the holy God, who is of
purer eyes than to behold iniquity. Oh, consider
what an eternity of misery must be the
position of all who die in their sins!’ She
heard me with much meekness and simplicity,
but answered that she had already advanced
the truth, and must persevere in the same spirit
to her last moments.” Efforts were made to
prevent Told from accompanying her any farther,
and the rioters were so exasperated
against her that Told seems only to have been
safe by keeping near to the sheriff along the
whole way. The sheriff also told him that he
would be giving a great satisfaction to the
whole nation, could he only bring her to a confession.
“Now, as we were proceeding on the
road, the sheriff’s horse being close to the cart,
I looked up at her from under the horse’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_246'>246</span>bridle, and I said, ‘My dear, look to Jesus.’
This quickened her spirit, insomuch that although
she had not looked about her before,
she turned herself round to me, and said, ‘Sir,
I bless God I can look to Jesus—to my comfort.’”</p>

<p class='c007'>Arrived at the place of execution, he spoke
to her again solemnly, “Did you not commit
the act? Had you no concern therein? Were
you not interested in the murder?” She said,
“I am as clear of the whole affair as I was the
day my mother brought me into the world.”
She was very young, she had all the aspects of
innocence about her. The sheriff burst into
tears, and turned his head away, exclaiming,
“Good God! it is a second Coleman’s case!”</p>

<p class='c007'>At this moment her cousin stepped up into
the cart, and sought to kiss her. She turned
her face away, and pushed him off. She had
before charged him with being the murderer—and
he was. When subsequently taken up for
another crime, he confessed the committal of
this. Her aunt had left to Mary, in the event
of her death, more money than to this wretch.
The executioner drew the cart away, and
Mary’s body—leaning the poor head, in her last
moments, on Silas’s shoulder—dear old Silas,
her only comfort in that terrible hour—fell into
the arms of death.  But he tells how she
<span class='pageno' id='Page_247'>247</span>was cold and still before the cart was drawn
away.</p>

<p class='c007'>But perhaps a still more pitiful case was that
of poor Anderson, who was hanged for stealing
sixpence: he was a labouring man, and had been
of irreproachable character. He and his wife—far
gone with child—were destitute of money,
clothes, and food. He said to his wife, “My
dear, I will go out, down to the quays; it may
be that the Lord will provide me with a loaf of
bread.” All his efforts were fruitless, but passing
through Hoxton Fields, he met two washerwomen.
He did not bid them stop, but he
said to one, “Mistress, I want money.” She
gave him twopence. He said to the other,
“You have money, I know you have.” She
said, “I have fourpence.” He took that. Insensible
of what might follow, as of what he had
done, he walked down into Old Street: there,
the two women having followed him gave him
in charge of a constable. He was tried, sentenced
to death, and for this he died. “Never,”
says Told, “through the years I have attended
the prisoners, have I seen such meek, loving,
patient spirits as this man and his wife.” Told
attended him to execution, and sought to comfort
the poor fellow by promising him to look
after his wife; and most tenderly did Told and
his wife redeem the promise, for they took her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_248'>248</span>for a short time into their own home. Told
obtained a housekeeper’s situation for her, and
she became a creditable and respected woman.
He bound her daughter apprentice to a weaver,
and she, probably, turned out well, although he
says, “I have never seen her but twice since,
which is many years ago.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Our readers will, perhaps, think that it is
time we drew these harrowing stories to a close;
but there are many more of them in this brief,
but most interesting, although forgotten autobiography.
They are recited with much pathos.
We have the story of Harris, the flying highwayman;
of Bolland, a sheriff’s officer, who was
executed for forging a note, although he had
refunded the money, and twice afterwards paid
the sum of the bill to secure himself. A young
gentleman, named Slocomb, defrauded his
father of three hundred pounds; his father
would not in any way stir, or remit his claim, to
save him. Told attended him and thought
highly of him, not only because he expressed
himself with so much resignation, but because
he never indulged a complaint against him
whom Told calls “that lump of adamant, his
father.” With him was executed another young
gentleman, named Powell, for forgery. Silas
Told also attended that cruel woman, Elizabeth
Brownrigg, who was executed for the atrocious
<span class='pageno' id='Page_249'>249</span>murder of her apprentices. And of all the
malefactors whom he attended she seems to us
the most unsatisfactory.</p>

<p class='c007'>We trust our readers will not be displeased
to receive these items from the biography of a
very remarkable, a singularly romantic and
chequered, as well as singularly useful career.
References to Silas Told will be found in most
of the biographies of Wesley. Southey passes
him by with a very slight allusion. Tyerman
dwells on his memory with a little more tenderness;
but, with the exception of Stevens, none
has touched with real interest upon this extraordinary
though obscure man, and his romantic
life and labours in a very strange path of Christian
benevolence and usefulness. He was
known, far and near, as the “prisoners’ chaplain,”
although an unpaid one. He closed his life
in 1778, in the sixty-eighth year of his age. As
we have seen, John Wesley appropriately officiated
at his funeral, and pronounced an affectionate
encomium over the remains of his honoured
old friend and fellow-labourer.</p>

  <h2 id='ch12' class='c004'>CHAPTER XII<br /> <br /><span class='small'>MISSIONARY SOCIETIES.</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c006'>Illustrating what we have said before, it
remains to be noticed, that nearly all the great
societies sprang into existence almost simultaneously.
The foremost among these,<a id='r14' /><a href='#f14' class='c012'><b>[14]</b></a> founded
in 1792, was the Baptist Missionary Society.
It appears to have arisen from a suggestion of
William Carey, the celebrated Northamptonshire
shoemaker, who proposed as an inquiry to
an association of Northamptonshire ministers,
“whether it were not practicable and obligatory
to attempt the conversion of the heathen.” It
is certainly still a moot question whether Le
Verrier or Adams first laid the hand of science
on the planet Neptune; but it seems quite certain
that, when one of God’s great thoughts is
throbbing in the heart of one of His apostles,
the same impulse and passion is stirring
<span class='pageno' id='Page_253'>253</span>another, perhaps others, in remote and faraway
scenes. Altogether unknown to William
Carey, that same year the great Claudius
Buchanan was dreaming his divine dreams
about the conquest of India for Christ, in St.
Mary’s College, Cambridge.<a id='r15' /><a href='#f15' class='c012'><b>[15]</b></a> Undoubtedly the
honour of the first consolidation of the thought
into a missionary enterprise must be given to
William Carey and his little band of obscure
believers.</p>

<div class='footnote c013' id='f14'>
<p class='c014'><span class='label'><a href='#r14'>14</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>It is not implied that these were the first modern missionary
agencies. The Moravians had already sent the Gospel into
many regions. There were Swedish and Danish Missionary
Societies also at work. In 1649 a Society for Promoting and
Propagating the Gospel of Jesus Christ in New England had been
formed, and about 1697 the “Society for Promoting Christian
Knowledge” and the “Society for the Propagation of the Gospel
in Foreign Parts” were established. See page <a href='#Page_256'>256</a> and foot note.</p>
</div>

<div class='footnote c013' id='f15'>

<div class='ic002'>
<p><span class='small'>William Carey.</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>At the close of Carey’s address, to which we
have referred, a collection was made for the
purpose of attempting a missionary crusade
upon Hindostan, amounting to £13 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> =
$65.60. The wits made fine work of this: the
reader may still turn to Sydney Smith’s paper
in the <i>Edinburgh Review</i>, in which the idea
and the effort are satirised as that of “an army
of maniacs setting forth to the conquest of
India.” But this humble effort resulted in
magnificent achievements; Carey and his illustrious
coadjutors, Ward and Marshman, set
forth, and became stupendous Oriental scholars,
translating the Word of Life into many
Indian dialects. Then came tempests of abuse
and scurrility at home from eminent pens. We
experience a shame in reading them; but it
shows the catholicity of spirit pervading the
minds of Christ’s real followers, that Lord
<span class='pageno' id='Page_254'>254</span>Teignmouth, and William Wilberforce, and Dr.
Buchanan, were amongst the ablest and most
earnest defenders of the noble Baptist missionaries.
We are able to see now that this mission
may be said to have saved India to the
British Empire. It not only created the
scholars to whom we have referred, and the
bands of holy labourers, but also the sagacity
of Lord Lawrence, and the consecrated courage
of Sir Henry Havelock. We are prepared,
therefore, to maintain that England is indebted
more to William Carey and his £13 2<i>s</i> 6<i>d.</i> than
to the cunning of Clive and the rapacity of
Warren Hastings.</p>

<p class='c007'>Another child of the Revival was born in
1795—the London Missionary Society. But it
would be idle to attempt to enumerate the
names either of its founders, its missionaries, or
their fields of labour; let the reader turn to the
names of the founders, and he will find they
were nearly all enthusiasts who had been baptised
into the spirit of the Revival—Rowland
Hill, Matthew Wilks, Alexander Waugh, William
Kingsbury, and, notably, Thomas Haweis,
the Rector of Aldwinckle and chaplain to the
Countess of Huntingdon. Nor must we omit
the name of David Bogue,<a id='r16' /><a href='#f16' class='c012'><b>[16]</b></a> that strong and eloquent
intelligence, whose admirable and suggestive
work on <i>The Divine Authority of the</i>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_255'>255</span><i>New Testament</i>, sent to Napoleon in his exile
at St. Helena by the Viscountess Duncan, was,
after the Emperor’s death, returned to the
author full of annotations, thus seeming to
give some clue to those religious conversations,
in which the illustrious exile certainly astonishes
us, not long before his departure.</p>

<div class='footnote c013' id='f16'>
<p class='c014'><span class='label'><a href='#r16'>16</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>See <a href='#p-254'>Appendix</a>.</p>
</div>

<p class='c007'>It is the London Missionary Society which
has covered the largest surface of the earth
with its missions, and it is not invidious to say
that its records register a larger range of conquests
over heathenism and idolatry than could
be chronicled in any age since the first apostles
went upon their way. We have only to remember

islands in the Southern Seas, with their chief
civiliser, the martyr of Erromanga; Africa, from
the Cape along through the deep interior, with
Moffatt and Livingstone, whose celebrated
motto was, “The end of the geographical feat

<p class='c007'>In 1799 the Church Missionary Society came
into existence. “What!” said the passionate
<span class='pageno' id='Page_256'>256</span>and earnest Rev. Melville Horne, in attempting
to arouse the clergy to missionary enthusiasm;
“have Carey and the Baptists had more
forgiven than we, that they should love more?
Have the fervent Methodists and patient
Moravians been extortionate publicans, that
they should expend their all in a cause which
we decline? Have our Independent brethren
persecuted the Church more, that they should
now be more zealous in propagating the faith
which it once destroyed?” And so the Church
Missionary Society arose;<a id='r18' /><a href='#f18' class='c012'><b>[18]</b></a> and in 1804, the
Bible Society; in 1805, the British and Foreign
School Society; in 1799, the Religious Tract
Society, which, since its foundation, has probably
circulated not less than five hundred millions
of publications. The Wesleyan Missionary
Society—which claims in date to take precedence
of all in its foundation in the year 1769—was
not formally constituted till 1817.<a id='r19' /><a href='#f19' class='c012'><b>[19]</b></a></p>

<p class='c014'><span class='label'><a href='#r19'>19</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>(The great missionary organizations of America belong to
the early part of this century. The First day or Sunday-school
Society was formed in 1791; the American Board of Commissioners
for Foreign Missions in 1810; the American Baptist
Missionary Union in 1814; Methodist Episcopal Missionary
Society in 1819; the Philadelphia Adult and Sunday-school
Union (which, in 1824, was merged in the American Sunday-school
Union) in 1817; the Protestant Episcopal Board of Missions
in 1821. Of Continental Societies, the Moravian Missionary
Society was formed in 1732; the Netherlands Missionary Society
in 1797; the Basle Evangelical Mission in 1816. Appendix.—<span class='sc'>Ed.</span>)</p>
</div>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_257'>257</span>Every one of these, and many other such associations,
alike show the vivid and vigorous
spirit which was abroad seeking to secure the
empire of the world to the cause of Divine truth
and love.</p>

<p class='c007'>And, meantime, what works were going on
at home? Education and intelligence were
widely spreading; simple academies were forming,
like that founded by the Countess of
Huntingdon at Trevecca, where the minds of
young men were being moulded and informed
to become the intelligent vehicles of the Gospel
message—eminently that of the great and
good Cornelius Winter, in Gloucestershire; and
that of David Bogue at Gosport; while, in the
north of England, arose the small but very
effective colleges of Bradford and Rotherham;
and the now handsome Lancashire Independent
College had its origin in the vestry of
Mosley Street Chapel, where the sainted
William Roby, as tutor, gathered around him
a number of young men, and armed them with
intellectual appliances for the work of the ministry.</p>

<p class='c007'>Some of the earliest efforts of Methodism,
and some of the most successful, had been in
the gaols, and among the malefactors of the
country—notably in the wonderful labours of
Silas Told, whose extraordinary story has been
<span class='pageno' id='Page_258'>258</span>recited in these pages. Silas passed away, but
an angel of light moved through the cells of
Newgate in the person of Elizabeth Fry, as
beautiful and commanding in her presence as
she was holy in her sweet and fervid zeal. Now
began thoughts too about the waifs and strays
of the population—the helpless and forgotten;
and John Townshend, an Independent minister,
laid the foundation of the first Deaf and
Dumb Asylum, the noble institution of London.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the world of politics, also, the men of the
Revival were exercising their influence, and
procuring charters of freedom for the mind of
the nation. Has it not been ever true that civil
and religious liberty have flourished side by
side? A blight cannot pass over one without
withering the other. The honour of the Repeal
of the Test and Corporation Acts is due to the
Great Revival: the Toleration Act of those
days was really more oppressive on pious members
of the Church of England than on Dissenters;
they could not obtain, as Dissenters could,
a licence for holding religious services in their
houses, because they were members of the
Church of England.</p>

<p class='c007'>William Wilberforce owed his first religious
impressions to the preaching of Whitefield;
with all his fine liberality of heart, he became
an ardent member of the communion of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_259'>259</span>Church of England. It seems incredible to
us now that he lived constantly in the expectation—we
will not say fear—of indictments
against him, for holding prayer-meetings and
religious services at his house in Kensington
Gore. Lord Barham, the father of the late amiable
and excellent Baptist Noel, was fined forty
pounds, on two informations of his neighbour,
the Earl of Romney, for a breach of the statute
in like services. That such a state of things
as this was changed to the free and happy ordinances
now in force, was owing to the spirit
which was abroad, giving not only freedom to
the soul of the man, but dignity and independence
to the social life of the citizen. Everywhere,
and in every department of life, the
spirit of the Revival moved over the face of the
waters, dividing the light from the darkness,
and thus God said, “Let there be light, and
there was light.”</p>

</div>
<p class='c006'>The effects of that great awakening which
we have thus attempted concisely, but fairly,
to delineate, are with us still; the strength is
diffused, the tone and colour are modified. One
chief purpose has guided the pen of the writer
throughout: it has been to show that the immense
regeneration effected in English manners
and society during the later years of the last
century and the first of the present, was the
result of a secret, silent, most subtle spiritual
force, awakening the minds and hearts of men
in most opposite parts of the nation, and in
widely different social circumstances. We
would give all honour where honour is due, remembering
that “Every good gift and every
perfect gift is from above.” There are writers
whose special admiration is given to some
favourite sect, some effective movement, or
some especially beloved name; but a dispassionate
view, an entrance—if we may be permitted
so to speak of it—into the camera, the
chamber of the times, presents to the eye a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_261'>261</span>long succession of actors, and brings out into
the clear light a wonderful variety of influences
all simultaneously at work to redeem society
from its darkness, and to give it a higher degree
of spiritual purity and mental and moral dignity.</p>

<p class='c007'>The first great workers were passing away,
most of them, as is usually the case, dying on
Pisgah, seeing most distinctly the future results
of their work, but scarcely permitted to enter
upon the full realisation of it. In 1791, in the
eighty-fourth year of her age, died the revered
Countess of Huntingdon; her last words, “My
work is done; I have nothing to do but to go
to my Father!” No chronicle of convent or of
canonisation, nor any story of biography, can
record, a more simple, saintly, and utterly unselfish
life. To the last unwearied, she was
daily occupied in writing long letters, arranging
for her many ministers, disposing of her chapel
trusts; sometimes feeling that her rank, and
certain suppositions as to the extent of her
wealth, made her an object upon which men
were not indisposed to exercise their rapacity.
Still, as compared with the state of society
when she commenced her work, in this her
closing year, she must have looked over a hopeful
and promising future, as sweet and enchanting
as the ineffably lovely scenery upon which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_262'>262</span>her eyes opened at Castle Doddington, and the
neighbouring beauties of her first wedded home.</p>

<p><span class='small'>JOHN WESLEY’S TOMB, CITY ROAD, LONDON.</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>In 1791, John Wesley, in his eighty-eighth
year, entered into his rest, faithfully murmuring,
as well as weakness and stammering lips could
articulate, “The best of all is, God is with us!”
Abel Stevens says, “His life stands out in the
history of the world, unquestionably pre-eminent
in religious labours above that of any other
man since the apostolic age.” It is not necessary,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_265'>265</span>in order to do Wesley sufficient honour,
to indulge in such invidious comparisons. It is
significant, however, that the last straggling
syllables which ever fell from the pen in his
beloved hand, were in a letter to William Wilberforce,
cheering him on in his efforts for
the abolition of slavery and the slave trade.
Charles Wesley had preceded his brother to his
rest in 1788, in the eightieth year of his age.</p>

<p class='c007'>Thus the earlier labourers were passing away,
and the work of the Revival was passing into
other forms, illustrating how not only “one
generation passeth away, and another cometh,”
but also how, as the workers pass, the work
abides. It would be very pleasant to spend
some time in noticing the interior of many old
halls, which were now opening, at once for the
entertainment of evangelists, and for Divine
service; prejudices were dying out, and so far
from the new religious life proving inimical to
the repose of the country, it was found to be
probably its surest security and friend; and
while the efforts were growing for carrying to
far-distant regions the truth which enlightens
and saves, anecdotes are not wanting to show
that it was this very spirit which created a
tender interest in maintaining and devising
means to make more secure the minister’s happiness
at home.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_266'>266</span>From many points of view William Wilberforce
maybe regarded as the central man of
the Revival in its new and crowning aspect; as
he bore the standard of England at that great
funeral which did honour to all that was mortal
of his friend William Pitt, on its way to the
vaults of the old Abbey, so, as his predecessors
departed, it devolved on him to bear the standard
of those truths and principles which had
effected the great change, and which were to
effect, if possible, yet greater changes. By his
sweet, winning, and if silvery, yet enchaining
and overwhelming eloquence, by his conversation,
which cannot have been, from the traditions
which are preserved of it, less than
wonderful, and by his lucid and practical pen,
he continued to give eminent effect to the Revival,
and to procure for its doctrines acceptance
in the highest circles of society. It is
perhaps difficult now to understand the cause of
the wonderful influence produced by his <i>Practical
View of Christianity</i>; that book itself
illustrates how the seeds of things are transmitted
through many generations. It is a long
way to look back to the poor pedlar who called
at the farm door of Richard Baxter’s father in
Eaton-Constantine, and sold there Richard
Sibbs’s <i>Bruised Reed</i>, but that was the birth-hour
of that great and transcendently glorious
<span class='pageno' id='Page_267'>267</span>book, <i>The Saint’s Everlasting Rest</i>. <i>The Saint’s
Everlasting Rest</i> was the inspiration of Philip
Doddridge, and to it we owe his <i>Rise and Progress
of Religion in the Soul</i>. Wilberforce read
that book, and it moved him to the desire to
speak out its earnestness, pathos, and solemnity
in tones suitable to the spirit of the Great Revival
which had been going on around him. A
young clergyman read the result of Wilberforce’s
wish in his <i>Practical View of Christianity</i>,
and he testifies, “To that book I owe a debt of
gratitude; to my unsought and unexpected introduction
to it, I owe the first sacred impressions
which I ever received as to the spiritual
nature of the Gospel system, the vital character
of personal religion, the corruption of the human
heart, and the way of salvation by Jesus
Christ.” And all this was very shortly given
to the world in those beautiful pieces, which it
surely must be ever a pleasure to read, whether,
for their tender delineation of the most important
truths, or the exquisite language, and the
delightful charm of natural scenery and pathetic
reflection in which the experiences of <i>The
Young Cottager</i>, <i>The Dairyman’s Daughter</i>, and
other “short and simple annals of the poor,”
are conveyed through the fascinating pen of
Legh Richmond.</p>

<p class='c007'>In this eminently lovely and lovable life we
<span class='pageno' id='Page_268'>268</span>meet with one on whom, assuredly, the mantle
of the old clerical fathers of the Revival had
fallen. He was a Churchman and a clergyman,
he loved and honoured his Church and its services
exceedingly; but it seems impossible to
detect, in any single act of his life or word of
his writings, a tinge of acerbity or bitterness.
The quiet and mellowed charm of his tracts—which
are certainly among the finest pieces of
writing in that way which we possess—appear
to have pervaded his whole life. Brading, in
the Isle of Wight, has been marvellously transformed
since he was the vicar of its simple little
church; the old parsonage, where little Jane
talked with her pastor, is now only a memory,
and no longer, as we saw it first many years
since, a feature in the charming landscape; and
the little epitaphs which the vicar himself wrote
for the stones, or wooden memorials over the
graves of his parishioners, are all obliterated by
time. Several years since we sought in vain
for the sweet verse on his own infant daughter,
although about thirty-five years since we read
it there:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“This early bud, so young and fair,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Called hence by early doom,</div>

      <div class='line in1'>In Paradise should bloom.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c018'>But these little papers of this excellent man
<span class='pageno' id='Page_269'>269</span>circulated wherever the English language was
spoken or read, and the spirit of their pages penetrated
farther than the pages themselves; while
they seem to present in a more pleasant, winning
and portable form the spirit of the Revival,
divested of much of the ruggedness which had,
naturally, characterized its earlier pens.</p>
<p class='c007'>Indeed, if some generalisation were needed
to express the phase into which the Revival
was passing, at this, the earlier part of the
present century, it should be called the “literary.”
Eminent names were appearing, and
eminent pens, to gather up the elements of
faith which had moved the minds and tongues
of men in past years, and to arrest the conscience
through the eye. This opens up a field
so large that we cannot do justice to it in these
brief sketches. To name here only one other
writer;—Thomas Scott, the commentator on
the Bible, and author of <i>The Force of Truth</i>,
is acknowledged to have exerted an influence
the greatness of which has been described in
glowing terms by men such as Sir. James
Stephen and John Henry Newman.</p>

</div>

<p class='c007'>No idea can be formed by those of the present
generation of the immense influence Charles
Simeon exercised over the mind of the Church
of England. He was the leader of the growing
evangelical party in the Church; his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_270'>270</span>doctrines were exactly those which had been
the favourite on the lips of Whitefield, Berridge,
Grimshaw, and Newton. His family was ancient
and respectable, he was the son of a Berkshire
squire. He had been educated at Eton,
and afterwards at King’s College, Cambridge;
he became very wealthy. His accession to the
life of the Revival seemed like an immense
addition of natural influence: he was faithful
and earnest, and, in the habits of his mind and
character, exactly what we understand by the
thorough English gentleman; almost may it be
said that he made the Revival “gentlemanly”
in clergymen. He opened the course of his
fifty-six years’ ministry in Cambridge amidst a
storm of persecution; the church wardens
<span class='pageno' id='Page_271'>271</span>attempted to crush him, the pews of his church
were locked up, and he was even locked out of
the building. Through all this he passed, and
he became, for the greater part of the long
period we have mentioned, the most noted
preacher of his town and university; and he
published, certainly, in his <i>Horæ Homileticæ</i> a
greater number of attempts at opening texts
in the form of sermons, than had ever been
given to the world. Simeon devoted his own
fortune and means for the purchase of advowsons,
in order that the pulpits of churches might
be filled by the representatives of his own opinions.
No history of the Revival can be
complete without noticing this phase, which
scattered over England, far more extensively
than can be here described, a new order of
clergyman, who have maintained in their circles
evangelical truth, and have held no inconsiderable
sway over the mind of the country.</p>

<p class='c007'>We only know history through men; events
are only possible through men, of whose mind
and activity they are the manifestation. This
brief succession of sketches has been very greatly
a series of portraits standing out prominently
from the scenery to which the character gave
effect; but of this singular, almost simultaneous
movement, how much has been left unrecorded!
It remains unquestionably true that no
<span class='pageno' id='Page_272'>272</span>adequate and perfectly impartial review of the
Revival has ever yet been written.</p>

<p class='c007'>The story of the Revival in Wales, what it
found there, and what it effected, is one of its
most interesting chapters. How deep was the
slumber when, about 1735-37, Howell Harris
began to traverse the Principality, exhorting
his neighbours concerning the interests of their
souls! another illustration that it was not from
one single spring that the streams of the Revival
poured over the land. It was rather like
some great mountain, such as Plinlimmon,
from whose high centre, elevated among the
clouds, leap forth five rivers, meandering among
the rocks in their brook-like way, until at last
they pour themselves along the lowlands in
broad and even magnificent streams, either
uniting as the Severn and the Wye, or finding
their separate way to the ocean. Whitefield
found his way to Wales, but Howell Harris was
already pouring out his consecrated life there;
to his assistance came the voice of Rowlands,
“the thunderer,” as he was called. Scientific
sermon-makers would say that Harris was no
great preacher; but he has been described as
the most successful and wonderful one who
ever ascended pulpit or platform in the Principality.
By the mingling of his tears and his
terrors, in seven years he roused the whole
<span class='pageno' id='Page_275'>275</span>country from one end to the other, north and
south; communicating the impulse of his zeal
to many like-minded men, by whose impassioned
words and indefatigable labours the
work was continued with signal and lasting results.<a id='r20' /><a href='#f20' class='c012'><b>[20]</b></a></p>

</div>

<p class='c007'>If the first throbbings of the coming Revival
were felt in Northampton, in America, in 1734,
beneath the truly awful words of the great
Jonathan Edwards, it was from England it derived
its sustenance, and assumed organisation
and shape. The Boston Elm, a venerable tree
near the centre of Boston Park, or common,
whose decayed limbs are still held together by
clamps or rivets of iron, while a railing defends
it from rude hands, is an object as sacred to the
traditions of Methodism in the United States,
as is Gwennap Pit to those of Methodism in
Western England. There Jesse Lee, the first
founder of Methodism in New England, commenced
the work in 1790, which has issued in
an organisation even more extensive and gigantic
than that which is associated with the
Conference in England. As the United States
have inherited from the mother country their
language, their literature, and their principles
of law, so also those great agitations of spiritual
<span class='pageno' id='Page_276'>276</span>life to which we have concisely referred,
crossed the Atlantic, and spread themselves
with power there.<a id='r21' /><a href='#f21' class='c012'><b>[21]</b></a></p>

</div>

<p class='c007'>It is not within our province to attempt to
enumerate all the sects, each with its larger or
lesser proportion of spiritual power, religious
activity, and general acceptance among the
people, to which the Revival gave birth;—such
as the large body of the Bible Christians of the
West of England; the Primitive Methodists of
the North, those who called themselves the
New Connection Methodists, or the United
Free Church Association. All these, and
others, are branches from the great central
stem. Neither is it in our province to notice
how the same universal agitation of religious
feeling, at exactly the same time, gave birth to
other forms, not regarded with so much complacency;—such
as the rugged and faulty faith
and following of that curious creature, William
Huntington, who, singular to say, found also
his best biographer in Robert Southey; or the
strangely multifarious works and rationalistic
development of Baron Swedenborg, which have,
at least, the merit of giving a more spiritual
rendering to the Christian system than that
which was found in the prevalent Arianism of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_277'>277</span>the period of their publication. Turn wherever
we may, it is the same. There was a deeper
upheaving of the religious life, and far more
widely spread, than perhaps any age of the
world since the time of the apostles had known
before.</p>

<p class='c007'>A change passed over the whole of English
society. That social state which we find described
in the pages of Fielding and Smollett,
and less respectable writers, passed away, and
passed away, we trust, for ever. The language
of impurity indulged with freedom by the dramatists
of the period when the Revival arose,
and read, and read aloud, by ladies and young
girls in drawing-rooms, or by parlour firesides,
became shameful and dishonoured. In the
course of fifty years, society, if not entirely
purged—for when may we hope for that blessedness?—was
purified. A sense of religious
decorum, and some idea of religious duty, took
possession of homes and minds which were not
at all impressed, either by the doctrines or the
discipline of Methodism. All this arose from
the new life which had been created.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was a fruitful soil upon which the revivalists
worked. There was a reverence for the
Bible as the word of God, a faith often held
very ignorantly, but it pervaded the land. The
Book was there in every parish church, and in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_278'>278</span>every hamlet; it became a kind of nexus of
union for true minds when they felt the power
of Divine principles. Thus, when, as the Revival
strengthened itself, the great Evangelic
party—a term which seems to us less open to
exception than “the Methodist party,” because
far more inclusive—met with the members of
the Society of Friends, they found that, with
some substantial differences, they had principles
in common. The Quakers had been long in
the land, but excepting in their own persons—and
they were few in number—they had not
given much effect to their principles. Methodism
roused the country; Quakerism, with its
more quiet thought, gave suggestions, plans,
largely supplied money. The great works
which these two have since unitedly accomplished
of educating the nation, and shaking
off the chain of the slave abroad, neither could
have accomplished singly; the conscience of
the country was prepared by Evangelic sentiment.
In taking up and working out the great
ideas of the Revival, we have never been
indifferent to the share due to members of the
Society of Friends. We have already spoken
of Elizabeth Fry, to whom many of the princes
of Europe in turn paid honour, to whom with
singular simplicity they listened as they heard
her preach. There are many names on which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_279'>279</span>we should like a little to dwell; missionaries as
arduous and earnest as any we have mentioned,
such as Stephen Grellet, Thomas Shillitoe, and
Thomas Chalkley. But this would enter into
a larger plan than we dare to entertain. Our
object now is only to say, how greatly other
nations, and the world at large, have benefited
by the awakening the conscience, the setting
free the mind, the education of the character,
by bringing all into immediate contact with
the Word of God and the truth which it unveils.</p>

<p class='c007'>Situated as we are now, amidst the movements
and agitations of uncertain seas of
thought, wondering as to the future, with
strong adjurations on every hand to renounce
the Word of Life, and to trust ourselves to the
filmy rationalism of modern speculation; while
we feel that for the future, and for those seas
over which we look there are no tide-tables, we
may, at least, safely affirm this, that the Bible
carries us beyond the highest water-mark;
that, as societies have constructed themselves
out of its principles they have built safely, not
only for eternal hope, but for human and social
happiness also; and we may safely ask human
thought—which, unaided and unenlightened
by revelation, has had a pretty fair field for the
exercise and display of its power in the history
of the world—to show to us a single chapter in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_280'>280</span>all the ages of its history, which has effected so
much for human, spiritual, intellectual, and
social well-being, as that which records the results
of the Great Revival of the Last Century.</p>

</div>
<p class='c006'>The labours of Whitefield had a remarkable
influence upon the extension of the Great Revival
in the colonies of America. In these
days of mammoth steamships and rapid railways,
equipped with drawing-room coaches,
travelling has become a pleasant pastime; but
a century and a half ago, when the sailing
vessel and the old lumbering stage-coach were
the most rapid and the chief means of public
conveyance, and when these were often uncertain
and irregular, subjecting the traveller to
frequent and annoying delays, if not disappointments,
it must have been a formidable
undertaking to cross the Atlantic and to journey
through a new country, almost a wilderness,
such long distances as from Georgia to
Massachusetts. Yet Whitefield, with a zeal
and a holy desire in “hunting for souls,” made
seven visits to America, crossing the ocean in
sailing-vessels thirteen times (“one voyage
lasting eleven weeks”), and travelled on his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_282'>282</span>preaching tours almost constantly. In one of
these visits he went upwards of 1,100 miles
through this then sparsely settled country, and
endured hardships and exposures from which a
far stronger and more vigorous constitution
might well shrink.</p>

<p class='c007'>As in England, so in the American colonies,
the decay of vital godliness which preceded
the great awakening had been long and deep.
It began in the latter part of the 17th century,
and its progress was observed with alarm by
many of the notable and godly men of the day.
Governor Stoughton, previous to resigning the
pulpit for the bench, proclaimed, at Boston,
that “many had become like Joash after the
death of Jehoiada—rotten, hypocritical, and a
lie!” The venerable Torrey of Weymouth, in
a sermon before the legislature, exclaimed,
“There is already a great death upon religion;
little more left than a name to live. It is dying
as to the being of it, by the general failure of
the work of conversion.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Mather, in 1700, asserts: “If the begun
apostasy should proceed as fast the next thirty
years as it has done these last, it will come to
that in New England (except the gospel itself
depart with the order of it) that churches must
be gathered out of churches.” President Willard
also published a sermon in the same year
<span class='pageno' id='Page_283'>283</span>on “The Perils of the Times Displayed,” in
which he asks, “Whence is there such a prevalency
of so many immoralities amongst professors?
Why so little success of the gospel?
How few thorough conversions to be observed;
how scarce and seldom! *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* It has been
a frequent observation that if one generation
begins to decline, the next that follows usually
grows worse; and so on, until God pours out
his spirit again upon them.”</p>

<p class='c007'>It was thirty years before the dawn of the
great awakening began to appear, even in the
colony of Massachusetts; but there were many
godly men in various portions of the American
colonies who had not yet bowed the knee to the
Baal of worldliness, and who earnestly sought,
by great fidelity in the presentation of the
truth, to arrest the evil tendency of the times.
Among them was that greatest of American
theologians, Jonathan Edwards. Beholding
the melancholy state of religion, not only at
Northampton, but in the surrounding regions,
and that this evil tendency was corrupting the
Church, he began to preach with greater boldness,
more especially with the purpose of
keeping error out of the Church than with the
design of awakening sinners. He was a man,
however, whose convictions were exceedingly
strong, and who preached the truth, not simply
<span class='pageno' id='Page_284'>284</span>for the purpose of gaining a worldly victory,
but because he loved the truth and the Spirit
wrought mightily by it. A surprising work of
grace attended his preaching. There was a
melting down of all classes and ages, in an
overwhelming solicitude about salvation; an
absorbing sense of eternal realities and self-abasement
and self-condemnation; a spirit of
secret and social prayer, followed by a concern
for the souls of others; and this awakening was
so sudden and solemn, that in many instances
it produced loud outcries, and in some cases
convulsions. Doubtless this great awakening
was as much a surprise to Edwards as to those
to whom he ministered.  Naturally, such a
wonderful work could not be confined to
Northampton alone; it began to extend to
other places in the colony. Remarkable and
widespread as this work of grace was, however,
it does not seem to have penetrated through
New England generally, until after the arrival
of Whitefield. The effect of Whitefield’s preaching
in Boston, says his biographer, was amazing.
Old Mr. Walter, the successor of Eliot,
the apostle to the Indians, declared it was Puritanism
revived.  So great was the interest
that his farewell sermon was attended by
twenty thousand persons. “Such a power and
presence of God with a preacher, and in religious
<span class='pageno' id='Page_285'>285</span>assemblies,” says Dr. Colman, “I
never saw before. Every day gives me fresh
proofs of Christ speaking in him.” And this
interest, great as it was, seemed, if possible,
exceeded at Northampton when Whitefield
met Edwards and reminded his people of the
days of old. A like success attended Whitefield’s
ministry in the town and college of
New Haven, and at Harvard College the effect
was remarkable. Secretary Willard, writing
to Whitefield, says: “That which forebodes
the most lasting advantage is the new state of
things in the college, where the impressions of
religion have been and still are very general,
and many in a judgment of charity brought
home to Christ. Divers gentlemen’s sons that
were sent there only for a more polite education,
are now so full of zeal for the cause of
Christ and the love of souls as to devote themselves
entirely to the study of divinity.” And
Dr. Colman wrote Whitefield, of Cambridge:
“The college is entirely changed; the students
are full of God, and will, I hope, come
out blessings in their generation, and I trust
are so now to each other. The voice of prayer
and praise fills their chambers, and sincerity,
fervency, and joy, with seriousness of heart, sit
visible on their faces.”</p>

<p class='c007'>On his return to Boston, in 1745, Whitefield
<span class='pageno' id='Page_286'>286</span>himself gives a similar testimony in regard to
the remarkable results of the Revival. He was
followed in his labours there by Gilbert Tennent,
a Presbyterian from New Jersey. That
this was not an overdrawn picture of the work
may be inferred from a public testimony given
by three of the leading ministers in Boston, the
Rev. Messrs. Prince, Webb, and Cooper.
Among other things, they said, “The wondrous
work of God at this day making its triumphant
progress through the land has forced many men
of clear minds, strong powers, considerable
knowledge, and firmly riveted in *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*
Socinian tenets, to give them all up at once
and yield to the adorable sovereignty and
irresistibility of the Divine Spirit in His saving
operations on the souls of men. For to see
such men as these, some of them of licentious
lives, long inured in a course of vice and of
high spirits, coming to the preaching of the
Word, some only out of curiosity, and mere design
to get matter of cavilling and banter, all
at once, in opposition to their inward resolutions
and resistances, to fall under an unexpected
and hated power, to have all the
strength of their resolution and resistance taken
away, to have such inward views of the horrid
wickedness not only of their lives but of their
hearts, with their exceeding great and immediate
<span class='pageno' id='Page_287'>287</span>danger of eternal misery as has amazed
their souls and thrown them into distress
unutterable, yea, forced them to cry out in the
assemblies with the greatest agonies, and then,
in two or three days, and sometimes sooner,
to have such unexpected and raised views of
the infinite grace and love of God in Christ, as
have enabled them to believe in Him; lifted
them at once out of their distress; filled
their hearts with admiration and joy unspeakable
and full of glory, breaking forth in their
shining countenances and transporting voices
to the surprise of those about them, kindling
up at once into a flame of love to God in utter
detestation of their former courses and vicious
habits,” fairly characterises this wonderful work
of God.</p>

<p class='c007'>Gilbert Tennent, who was pressed into the
field by Whitefield, was born in Ireland, and
brought to this country by his father, and was
educated for the ministry. As a preacher he
was, in his vigorous days, equalled by few.
His reasoning powers were strong, his language
was forcible and often sublime, and his manner
of address warm and earnest. His eloquence
was, however, rather bold and awful than soft
and persuasive, he was most pungent in his
address to the conscience. When he wished to
alarm the sinner, he could represent in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_288'>288</span>most awful manner the terrors of the Lord.
With admirable dexterity he exposed the false
hope of the hypocrite, and searched the corrupt
heart to the bottom. Such were some of the
qualifications of the man whom Whitefield
chose to continue his work in America. He
entered on his new labours with almost rustic
simplicity, wearing his hair undressed and a
large great-coat girt with a leathern girdle.
He was of lofty stature and dignified and grave
aspect. His career as a preacher in New Jersey
had been remarkable, and now in New England
his ministry was hardly less successful than
that of Whitefield. He actually shook the
country as with an earthquake. Wherever he
came hypocrisy and Pharisaism either fell
before him or gnashed their teeth against him.
Cold orthodoxy also started from her downy
cushion to imitate or to denounce him. So testifies
the author of the “<i>Life and Times of
Whitefield</i>.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Whitefield’s first reception in New York was
not particularly flattering. He was refused the
use of both the church and the court-house. “The
commissary of the Bishop,” he says, “was full
of anger and resentment, and denied me the use
of his pulpit before I asked him for it.” He replied,
“I will preach in the fields, for all places
are alike to me.” At a subsequent visit he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_289'>289</span>preached there seven weeks with great acceptableness
and success. Even his first labours
were not wholly in vain. Dr. Pemberton wrote
to him that many were deeply affected, and
some who had been loose and profligate were
ashamed and set upon thorough reformation.
The printers also at New York, as at Philadelphia,
applied to him for sermons to publish,
assuring him “that hundreds had called for
them, and that thousands would purchase them.”
Of his later visit he says, “Such flocking of all
ranks I never saw before.” At New York
many of the most respectable gentlemen and
merchants went home with him after his sermons
to hear something more of the kingdom
of Christ.</p>

<p class='c007'>“At Philadelphia,” says Philip, in his Life
and Times of Whitefield, “his welcome was
cordial. Ministers and laymen of all denominations
visited him, inviting him to preach.
He was especially pleased to find that they
preferred sermons when not delivered within
church walls. It was well they did, for his
fame had reached the city before he arrived and
this collected crowds which no church could
contain. The court-house steps became his
pulpit, and neither he nor the people wearied,
although the cold winds of November blew
upon them night after night.” Previous to one
<span class='pageno' id='Page_290'>290</span>of his visits in Philadelphia, a place was erected
in which Whitefield could preach, and its
managers offered him £800 annually, with
liberty to travel six months in a year wherever
he chose, if he would become their pastor.
Though pleased with the offer he promptly
declined it. He was more pleased to learn that
in consequence of a former visit there were so
many under soul-sickness that even Gilbert
Tennent’s feet were blistered with walking
from place to place to see them.</p>

<p class='c007'>Of his work in Maryland he writes, that he
found those who had never heard of redeeming
grace. The harvest is promising. “Have
Marylanders also received the grace of God?
Amazing love. Maryland is yielding converts
to Jesus; the Gospel is moving southwards.”</p>

<p class='c007'>He frequently visited New Jersey (Princeton)
College, and there won many young
and bright witnesses for Christ. Hearing that
sixteen students had been converted at a
former visit, he again went thither to fan the
flame he had kindled among the students, and
says that he had four sweet seasons which
resembled old times. His spirits rose at the
sight of the young soldiers who were to fight
when he fell.</p>

<p class='c007'>Although at times prejudice ran high against
the Indians, Whitefield espoused their cause as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_291'>291</span>a philanthropist, and preached to them through
interpreters at the Indian school of Lebanon,
under Dr. Wheelock, where the sight of a promising
nursery for future missionaries greatly
inspired him. And at one of the stations
maintained by the sainted Brainerd, he
preached, found converted Indians, and saw
nearly fifty young ones in one school learning
a Bible catechism. In the Indian school at
Lebanon he became so interested that he
appealed to the public and collected £120 at
one meeting for its maintenance. Wherever
he went he saw the Redeemer’s stately steps
in the great congregations which he addressed.</p>

<p class='c007'>If there was any one point about which
Whitefield’s interest centered in America, it
was in the orphan asylum which he aided in
establishing in Georgia. This was his “Bethesda.”
The prosperity of the orphan home
was engraved upon his heart as with the point
of a diamond, and it was ever vividly present to
him wherever he went. At one of his visits
on parting with the inmates he says: “Oh,
what a sweet meeting I had with my dear
friends! What God has prepared for me I
know not; but surely I cannot expect a greater
happiness until I embrace the saints in glory!
When I parted my heart was ready to break
with sorrow, but now it almost bursts with joy.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_292'>292</span>Oh, how did each in turn hang upon my neck,
kiss and weep over me with tears of joy! And
my own soul was so full of the sense of God’s
love, when I embraced one friend in particular,
that I thought I should have expired in the place.
I felt my soul so full of the sense of Divine
goodness that I wanted words to express myself.
When we came to public worship, young
and old were all dissolved in tears. After
service several of my parishioners, all of my
family, and the little children returned home
crying along the street, and some could not avoid
praying very loud. Being very weak in body
I laid myself upon a bed, but finding so many
in a weeping condition I rose and betook myself
to prayer again, but had I not lifted up my
voice very high the groans and cries of the
children would have prevented me from being
heard. This continued for near an hour, till at
last, finding their concern rather to increase
than to abate, I desired all to retire. Then
some or other might be heard praying earnestly
in every corner of the house. It happened at
this time to thunder and lighten, which added
very much to the solemnity of the night. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* I
mention the orphans in particular, that their
benefactors may rejoice at what God is doing
for their souls.”</p>

<p class='c007'>It is evident that Whitefield had a very
<span class='pageno' id='Page_293'>293</span>tender heart towards all children. One of his
most effective sermons at Webb’s Chapel,
Boston, was occasioned by the touching remark
of a dying boy, who had heard him the day
before. The boy was taken ill after the sermon,
and said, “I want to go to Mr. Whitefield’s
God”—and expired. This touched the
secret place of both the thunder and the tears
of Whitefield. He says, “It encouraged me to
speak to the little ones, but oh, how were the
old people affected when I said, ‘Little children,
if your parents will not come to Christ, do
you come and go to heaven without them.’”
After this awful appeal no wonder that there
were but few dry eyes.</p>

<p class='c007'>Another remarkable evidence of the extent
and power of the Revival, and of the versatility
of Mr. Whitefield’s talents, is shown in
the effect produced upon the negro mind.
The intensest interest prevailed among even
the poorest slaves. Upon one occasion Whitefield
was very ill, and in the hands of the physician
to the time when he was expected to
preach. Suddenly he exclaimed, “My pains
are suspended; by the help of God I will go
and preach, and then come home and die!”
With some difficulty he reached the pulpit. All
were surprised, and looked as though they saw
one risen from the dead. He says of himself, “I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_294'>294</span>was as pale as death, and told them they must
look upon me as a dying man come to bear my
dying testimony to the truths I had formerly
preached to them. All seemed melted, and
were drowned in tears. The cry after me when
I left the pulpit was like the cry of sincere
mourners when attending the funeral of a dear
departed friend. Upon my coming home,
I was laid upon a bed upon the ground near
the fire, and I heard them say, ‘He is gone!’
but God was pleased to order it otherwise. I
gradually recovered. At this time a poor
negro woman insisted upon seeing him when
he began to recover. She came in and sat on
the ground, and looked earnestly into his face;
then she said, in broken accents: “Massa, you
jest go to hebben’s gate; but Jesus Christ said,
‘Get you down, get you down; you musn’t
come here yet; go first and call some more poor
negroes.’” Many colored people came to him
asking, “Have I a soul?” Many societies for
prayer and mutual instruction were set up. Mr.
Seward, a travelling companion of Whitefield,;
relates that a drinking club, whereof a clergyman
was a member, had a negro boy attending
them, who used to mimic people for their diversion.
They called on him to mimic Whitefield,
which he was very unwilling to do; but they
insisted upon it. He stood up and said:—“I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_295'>295</span>speak the truth in Christ, I lie not, unless you
repent you will all be damned.” Seward adds,
“This unexpected speech broke up the club,
which has never met since.”</p>

<p class='c007'>At Savannah, Charleston, and other southern
cities, the Great Revival had a remarkable success.
Josiah Smith, an Independent minister
of Charleston, published a sermon on the
character and preaching of Whitefield, defending
his doctrines, his personal character, and
describing his manner of preaching. Of Whitefield’s
power he says: “He is certainly a
finished preacher; a noble negligence ran
through his style; the passion and flame of his inspiration
will, I trust, be long felt by many. How
was his tongue like the pen of a ready writer,
touched as with a coal from the altar! With
what a flow of words, what a ready profusion of
language did he speak to us upon the concerns
of our souls! In what a flaming light did he
set <i>our</i> eternity before us! How earnestly he
pressed Christ upon us! The awe, the silence,
the attention, which sat upon the faces of the
great audience was an argument, how he could
reign over all their powers. Many thought he
spake as never man spake before him. So
charmed were the people with the manner of
his address that they shut up their shops, forgot
their secular business, and the oftener he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_296'>296</span>preached the keener edge he seemed to put
upon their desires to hear him again. How
awfully—with what thunder and sound—did he
discharge the artillery of heaven upon us!
Eternal themes, the tremendous solemnities of
our religion were all alive upon his tongue. He
struck at the politest and most modish of our
vices, and at the most fashionable entertainments,
regardless of every one’s presence but
His in whose name he spake with this authority.
And I dare warrant if none should go to
these diversions until they had answered the
solemn questions he put to their consciences,
our theatres would soon sink and perish.” Mr.
Smith adds that £600 were contributed in
Charleston to the orphan house.</p>

<p class='c007'>The wonderful quickening which the Great
Revival gave to benevolent and charitable
enterprises deserves at least a passing allusion.
Besides sending forth into mission work such
men as David Brainerd, and even Jonathan
Edwards himself, it also laid the foundation
more securely of many of our Christian colleges,
and of not a few of our orphan asylums. Whitefield
founded his Bethesda upon a tract of land
covering about 500 acres, ten miles from Savannah,
and laid out the plan of the building,
employed workmen, hired a large house, took
in 24 orphans, incurred at once the heavy
<span class='pageno' id='Page_297'>297</span>responsibilities of a large family and a larger
institution, encouraged, as he says, by the
example of Professor Francke. Yet on looking
back to this first undertaking he said: “I forgot
that Professor Francke built in a populous
country and that I was building at the very tail
end of the world, which rendered it by far the
most expensive part of all his Majesty’s dominions;
but had I received more and ventured
less, I should have suffered less and others
more.” He undertook to provide for his 40
orphans and 60 servants and workmen with no
fears nor misgivings of heart. “Near a hundred
mouths,” he writes, “are daily to be supplied
with food. The expense is great, but our great
and good God, I am persuaded, will enable me
to defray it.” He spent a winter at Bethesda
in 1764, and of the success of his orphanage he
says, “Peace and plenty reign at Bethesda; all
things go on successfully. God has given me
great favour in the sight of the governor, council,
and assembly. A memorial was presented
for an additional grant of land consisting of
about 2,000 acres, and was immediately complied
with. Every heart seems to leap for joy
at the prospect of its future utility to this and
the neighbouring colonies.”</p>

<p class='c007'>This great religious movement did not progress
without stirring up much bitterness. It
<span class='pageno' id='Page_298'>298</span>was even asserted by President Clap, of New
Haven, that he came into New England to
turn out the generality of their ministers, and to
replace them with ministers from England,
Ireland, and Scotland. “Such a thought,”
replies Whitefield, “never entered my heart,
neither has, as I know of, my preaching any
such tendency.” It is said of one minister that
he went merely to pick a hole in Whitefield’s
coat, but confessed that God picked a hole in
his heart, and afterward healed it by the blood
of Christ. After one of his visits not less
than twenty ministers in the neighbourhood of
Boston did not hesitate to call Whitefield their
spiritual father, tracing their conversion to his
preaching. These men immediately entered
upon a similar work, spreading the great
awakening throughout that colony.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the progress of this work under Whitefield
and others, there were frequent outbursts of
wit and grim humor. Thus when pastors were
shy of giving Whitefield and his associates a
place in their pulpits and the people voted to
allow them to preach in their churches, Whitefield
said, “The <i>lord</i>-brethren of New England
could tyrannize as well as the <i>lord</i>-bishops of
Old England.” The caricatures issued from
Boston in regard to the work were designated
as half-penny squibs; and a good old Puritan
of the city said, “they did not weigh much.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_299'>299</span>Of the religion of America Whitefield writes:
“I am more and more in love with the good
old Puritans. I am pleased at the thought of
sitting down hereafter with the venerable
Cotton, Norton, Eliot, and that great cloud of
witnesses who first crossed the western ocean
for the sake of the sacred gospel and the faith
once delivered to the saints. At present my
soul is so filled that I can scarce proceed.”
Again he writes: “It is too much for one man
to be received as I have been by thousands.
The thoughts of it lay me low but I cannot get
low enough. I would willingly sink into
nothing before the blessed Jesus—my all in all.”
And again, “I love those that thunder out the
Word. The Christian world is in a deep sleep,
nothing but a loud voice can awaken them out
of it. Had we a thousand hands and tongues
there is employment enough for them all.
People are everywhere ready to perish for
lack of knowledge.” To an aged veteran he
writes from North Carolina, “I am here hunting
in the woods—these ungospelized wilds—for
sinners. It is pleasant work, though my body
is weak and crazy. But after a short fermentation
in the grave, it will be fashioned like unto
Christ’s glorious body. The thought of this
rejoices my soul and makes me long to leap my
seventy years. I sometimes think all will go to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_300'>300</span>heaven before me. Pray for me as a dying man,
but, oh, pray that I may not go off as a snuff.
I would fain die blazing—not with human glory,
but with the love of Jesus.” Such was the
spirit filling the great souls of those who were
God’s instruments in spreading the revival in
America. Mr. Whitefield died at Newburyport,
Massachusetts, Sept. 30, 1770, having
preached the day before at Exeter, and his body
rests in a crypt or tomb beneath the Presbyterian
church at that place.</p>

<p class='c007'>Of the effects of the Great Revival in
America, Dr. Abel Stevens says, “The Congregational
churches of New England, the
Presbyterians and Baptists of the Middle States,
and the mixed colonies of the South, owe their
late religious life and energy mostly to the
impulse given by his [Whitefield’s] powerful
ministrations.” *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* In Pennsylvania and New
Jersey, where Frelinghuysen, Blair, Rowland,
and the two Tennents had been labouring with
evangelistic zeal, he was received as a prophet
of God, and it was then that the Presbyterian
Church took that attitude of evangelical power
and aggression which has ever since characterized
it.</p>

<p class='c007'>A single incident will illustrate the effect of
the Revival upon unbelievers and skeptics. A
noted officer of Philadelphia, who had long
<span class='pageno' id='Page_301'>301</span>been almost an atheist, crept into the crowd
one night to hear a sermon on the visit of
Nicodemus to Christ. When he came home,
his wife not knowing where he had been,
wished he had heard what she had been hearing.
He said nothing. Another and another
of his family came in and made a similar remark
till he burst into tears and said, “I have been
hearing him and approve of his sermon.” He
afterwards became a sincere Christian with the
spirit of a martyr.</p>

<p class='c007'>These etchings of a few scenes and fewer
facts indicate the scope, the depth, and the
sweep of the Great Revival of the 18th century
in America. No attempt has been made to
sum up its results, nor has it come within the
purpose of this work to give an inward history
of the movement, nor to explain the philosophy
of it. These intricate questions may be left to
philosophers; the Christian delights to know
the facts; he will cheerfully wait for the future
life to unfold all the mystery and philosophy of
the plan and work of salvation. Then, as
Whitefield exclaims, “What amazing mysteries
will be unfolded when each link in the golden
chain of providence and grace shall be seen and
scanned by beatified spirits in the kingdom of
heaven! Then all will appear symmetry and
harmony, and even the most intricate and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_302'>302</span>seemingly most contrary dispensations, will be
evidenced to be the result of infinite and consummate
wisdom, power, and love. Above all,
there the believer will see the infinite depths of
that mystery of godliness, ‘God manifested in
the flesh,’ and join with that blessed choir, who,
with a restless unweariedness, are ever singing
the song of Moses and the Lamb.”</p>

<p class='c016'>The Puritans were men whose minds had derived a peculiar
character from the daily contemplation of superior beings and
eternal interests. Not content with acknowledging, in general
terms, an overruling Providence, they habitually ascribed every
event to the will of the Great Being, for whose power nothing was
too vast, for whose inspection nothing was too minute. To know
him, to serve him, to enjoy him, was, with them, the great end
of existence. They rejected, with contempt, the ceremonious
homage which other sects substituted for the pure worship of
the soul. Instead of catching occasional glimpses of the Deity
through an obscuring veil, they aspired to gaze full on his intolerable
brightness, and to commune with him face to face. Hence
originated their contempt for terrestrial distinctions. The difference
between the greatest and the meanest of mankind seemed
to vanish, when compared with the boundless interval which
separated the whole race from Him on whom their own eyes were
constantly fixed. They recognized no title to superiority but His
favor; and, confident of that favor, they despised all the accomplishments
and all the dignities of the world. If they were unacquainted
with the works of philosophers and poets, they were
deeply read in the oracles of God. If their names were not found
in the registers of heralds, they were recorded in the Book of
Life. If their steps were not accompanied by a splendid train
of menials, legions of ministering angels had charge over them.
Their palaces were houses not made with hands; their diadems
crowns of glory which should never fade away. On the rich and
the eloquent, on nobles or priests they looked down with contempt,
for they esteemed themselves rich in a more precious
measure, and eloquent in a more sublime language—nobles by
right of an earlier creation, and priests by the imposition of a
mightier hand. The very meanest of them was a being to whose
fate a mysterious and terrible importance belonged, on whose
slightest action the spirits of light and darkness looked with
anxious interest, who had been destined, before Heaven and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_304'>304</span>earth were created, to enjoy a felicity which should continue
when heaven and earth should have passed away. Events
which short-sighted politicians ascribed to earthly causes, had
been ordained on his account. For his sake empires had risen,
and flourished, and decayed. For his sake the Almighty had
proclaimed His will by the pen of the Evangelist, and the harp
of the prophet. He had been wrested by no common deliverer
from the grasp of no common foe. He had been ransomed by
the sweat of no vulgar agony, by the blood of no earthly sacrifice.
It was for him that the sun had been darkened, that the rocks
had been rent, that the dead had risen, that all nature had
shuddered at the sufferings of her expiring God.</p>

<p class='c007'>Thus the Puritan was made up of two different men: the one
all self-abasement, penitence, gratitude, passion; the other
proud, calm, inflexible, sagacious. He prostrated himself in the
dust before his Maker, but he set his foot on the neck of his
king. In his devotional retirement, he prayed with convulsions,
and groans and tears. He was half maddened by glorious or
terrible illusions. He heard the lyres of angels or the tempting
whispers of fiends. He caught a gleam of the Beatific Vision,
or woke screaming from dreams of everlasting fire. Like Vane,
he thought himself entrusted with the sceptre of the millennial
year. Like Fleetwood, he cried in the bitterness of his soul that
God had hid His face from him. But when he took his seat
in the council, or girt on his sword for war, these tempestuous
workings of the soul had left no perceptible trace behind them.
People who saw nothing of the godly but their uncouth visages,
and heard nothing from them but their groans and their whining
hymns, might laugh at them. But those had little reason to
laugh who encountered them in the hall of debate, or on the field
of battle. These fanatics brought to civil and military affairs a
coolness of judgment and an immutability of purpose which
some writers have thought inconsistent with their religious zeal,
but which were in fact the necessary effects of it. The intensity
of their feelings on one subject made them tranquil on every
other. One overpowering sentiment had subjected to itself pity
and hatred, ambition and fear. Death had lost its terrors and
pleasure its charms. They had their smiles and their tears,
their raptures and their sorrows, but not for the things of this
world. Enthusiasm had made them stoics, had cleared their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_305'>305</span>minds from every vulgar passion and prejudice, and raised
them above the influence of danger and of corruption. It sometimes
might lead them to pursue unwise ends, but never to
choose unwise means. They went through the world, like Sir
Artegal’s iron man Talus with his flail, crushing and trampling
down oppressors, mingling with human beings, but having
neither part nor lot in human infirmities, insensible to fatigue,
to pleasure, and to pain, not to be pierced by any weapon, not to
be withstood by any barrier.—<i>Macaulay’s Essay on Milton.</i></p>

<p class='c016'>“‘The Vicar of Wakefield’ is a domestic epic. Its hero is a
country parson—simple, pious and pure-hearted—a humourist in
his way, a little vain of his learning, a little proud of his fine
family—sometimes rather sententious, never pedantic, and a
dogmatist only on the one favorite topic of monogamy, which
crops out now and then above the surface of his character, only
to give it a new charm. Its world is a rural district, beyond
whose limits the action rarely passes, and that only on great occasions.
Domestic affections and joys, relieved by its cares, its
foibles, and its little failings, cluster around the parsonage, till
the storms from the outward world invade its holiness and trouble
its peace. Then comes sorrow and suffering; and we have
the hero, like the patriarchal prince of the land of Uz, when the
Lord ‘put forth His hand and touched all that He had,’ meeting
each new affliction with meekness and with patience—rising from
each new trial with renewed reliance upon God, till the lowest
depth of his earthly suffering becomes the highest elevation of
his moral strength.”</p>

<p class='c016'>The most interesting phases which the Reformation anywhere
assumes, especially for us English, is that of Puritanism. In
Luther’s own country, Protestantism soon dwindled into a rather
barren affair, not a religion or faith, but rather now a theological
jangling of argument, the proper seat of it not the heart; the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_306'>306</span>essence of it skeptical contention; which, indeed, has jangled
more and more, down to Voltairism itself; through Gustavus
Adolphus contentions onward to French-Revolution cries! But
on our island there arose a Puritanism, which even got itself established
as a Presbyterianism and national church among the
Scotch; which came forth as a real business of the heart; and
has produced in the world very notable fruit. In some senses
one may say it is the only phase of Protestantism that ever got to
the rank of being a faith, a true communication with Heaven,
and of exhibiting itself in history as such. We must spare a few
words for Knox; himself a brave and remarkable man; but
still more important as chief priest and founder, which one may
consider him to be, of the faith that became Scotland’s, New
England’s, Oliver Cromwell’s. History will have something to
say about this for some time to come!</p>

<p class='c007'>We may censure Puritanism as we please; and no one of us, I
suppose, but would find it a very rough, defective thing; but
we, and all men, may understand that it was a genuine thing;
for nature has adopted it, and it has grown and grows. I say
sometimes that all goes by wager of battle in this world; that
<i>strength</i>, well understood, is the measure of all worth. Give a
thing time; if it can succeed, it is a right thing. Look now at
American Saxondom; and at that little fact of the sailing of the
Mayflower, two hundred years ago, from Delft Haven, in Holland!
Were we of open sense, as the Greeks were, we had
found a poem here; one of nature’s own poems, such as she
writes in broad facts over great continents. For it was properly
the beginning of America: there were straggling settlers in
America before, some material as of a body was there; but the
soul of it was first this. These poor men, driven out of their
own country, not able well to live in Holland, determined on
settling in the New World. Black, untamed forests are there,
and wild, savage creatures; but not so cruel as star-chamber
hangmen. They thought the earth would yield them food, if they
tilled honestly; the everlasting Heaven would stretch there, too,
overhead; they should be left in peace, to prepare for Eternity
by living well in this world of time; worshipping in what they
thought the true, not the idolatrous way. They clubbed their
small means together; hired a ship, the little ship Mayflower,
and made ready to set sail. In <i>Neal’s History of the Puritans</i> is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_307'>307</span>an account of the ceremony of their departure; solemnity, we
might call it, rather, for it was a real act of worship. Their
minister went down with them to the beach, and their brethren,
whom they were to leave behind; all joined in solemn prayer
that God would have pity on His poor children, and go with
them into that waste wilderness, for He also had made that, He
was there also as well as here. Hah! These men, I think, had
a work! The weak thing, weaker than a child, becomes strong
one day, if it be a true thing. Puritanism was only despicable,
laughable then; but nobody can manage to laugh at it now.
Puritanism has got weapons and sinews; it has fire-arms, war
navies; it has cunning in its ten fingers, strength in its right
arm: it can steer ships, fell forests, remove mountains; it is one
of the strongest things under this sun at present!—<i>Carlyle on

<p class='c016'>It has been said of Lady Huntingdon that “almost from infancy
an uncommon seriousness shaded the natural gladness of her
childhood,” and that, without any positive religious instruction,
for none knew her “inward sorrows,” when she was a “little
girl, nor were there any around her who could have led her to
the balm there is in Gilead,” she devoutly and diligently
searched the Scriptures, if haply she might find that precious
something which her soul craved.</p>

<p class='c007'>During the first years of her married life (she was married at
the age of 21 and in the year 1728), “her chief endeavor *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*
was to maintain a conscience void of offense. She strove
to fulfill the various duties of her position with scrupulous exactness;
she was sincere, just and upright; she prayed, fasted
and gave alms; she was courteous, considerate and charitable.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Her husband, Lord Huntingdon, had a sister, Lady Margaret
Hastings, who, under the preaching of Mr. Ingham, in Ledstone
Church in Yorkshire, was converted. Afterwards, when visiting
her brother, these words were uttered by her: “Since I have
known and believed in the Lord Jesus for salvation, I have been
as happy as an angel.” The expression was strange to Lady
Huntingdon—it alarmed her—she sought to work out a righteousness
<span class='pageno' id='Page_308'>308</span>of her own, but the effort only widened the breach between
herself and God. “Thus harassed by inward conflicts,
Lady Huntingdon was thrown upon a sick bed, and after many
days and nights seemed hastening to the grave. The fear of
death fell terribly upon her.”</p>

<p class='c007'>In that condition the words of Lady Margaret recurred with a
new meaning. “I too will wholly cast myself on Jesus Christ
for life and salvation,” was her last refuge; and from her bed
she lifted up her heart to God for pardon and mercy through
the blood of His Son. “Lord, I believe; help Thou mine unbelief,”
was her prayer. Doubt and distress vanished and joy and
peace filled her bosom.—<i>From “Lady Huntingdon and her

<p class='c016'>“It is easier to justify the heads of the restored Clergy upon
this point [want of uniformity or unity in the Church of England],
than to excuse them for appropriating to themselves the
wealth which, in consequence of the long protracted calamities
of the nation, was placed at their disposal. The leases of the
church lands had almost all fallen in; there had been no renewal
for twenty years, and the fines which were now raised
amounted to about a million and a half. Some of this money
was expended in repairing, as far as was reparable, that havoc
in churches and cathedrals which the fanatics had made in their
abominable reign; some also was disposed of in ransoming English
slaves from the Barbary pirates; but the greater part went
to enrich individuals and build up families, instead of being employed,
as it ought to have been, in improving the condition of
the inferior clergy. Queen Anne applied the tenths and first
fruits to this most desirable object; but the effect of her augmentation
was slow and imperceptible: they continued in a
state of degrading poverty, and that poverty was another cause
of the declining influence of the Church, and the increasing irreligion
of the people.</p>

<p class='c007'>A further cause is to be found in the relaxation of discipline.
In the Romish days it had been grossly abused; and latterly
also it had been brought into general abhorrence and contempt
<span class='pageno' id='Page_309'>309</span>by the tyrannical measures of Laud on one side, and the absurd
vigor of Puritanism on the other. The clergy had lost that
authority which may always command at least the appearance
of respect; and they had lost that respect also by which the
place of authority may sometimes so much more worthily be
supplied. For the loss of power they were not censurable; but
if they possessed little of that influence which the minister who
diligently and conscientiously discharges his duty will certainly
acquire, it is manifest that, as a body, they must have been culpably
remiss. From the Restoration to the accession of the
House of Hanover, the English Church could boast of some of
its brightest ornaments and ablest defenders; men who have
neither been surpassed in piety, nor in erudition, nor in industry,
nor in eloquence, nor in strength and subtlety of mind: and
when the design for re-establishing popery in these kingdoms
was systematically pursued, to them we are indebted for that
calm and steady resistance, by which our liberties, civil as well
as religious, were preserved. But in the great majority of the
clergy zeal was awanting. The excellent Leighton spoke of the
Church as a fair carcass without a spirit; in doctrine, in worship,
and in the main part of its government, he thought it the best
constituted in the world, but one of the most corrupt in its administration.
And Burnet observes, that in his time our clergy
had less authority, and were under more contempt, than those
of any other church in Europe; for they were much the most
remiss in their labors, and the least severe in their lives. It
was not that their lives were scandalous; he entirely acquitted
them of any such imputation; but they were not exemplary as
it became them to be: and in the sincerity and grief of a pious
and reflecting mind, he pronounced that they should never regain
the influence which they had lost, till they lived better and
labored more.”—<i>Southey’s Life of Wesley.</i></p>

<p class='c016'>“The observant Frenchman to whom we have several times
referred, M. Grosley, says of the ‘sect of the Methodists,’ ‘this
establishment has borne all the persecutions that it could possibly
apprehend in a country as much disposed to persecution as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_310'>310</span>England is the reverse.’ The light literature of forty years overflows
with ridicule of Methodism. The preachers are pelted by
the mob; the converts are held up to execration as fanatics or
hypocrites. Yet Methodism held the ground it had gained. It
had gone forth to utter the words of truth to men little above the
beasts that perish, and it had brought them to regard themselves,
as akin to humanity. The time would come when its earnestness
would awaken the Church itself from its somnolency,
and the educated classes would not be ashamed to be religious.
There was wild enthusiasm enough in some of the followers of
Whitefield and Wesley; much self seeking; zeal verging upon
profaneness; moral conduct, strongly opposed to pious profession.
But these earnest men left a mark upon their time which
can never be effaced. The obscure young students at Oxford in
1736, who were first called ‘Sacramentarians,’ then ‘Bible
moths,’ and finally ‘Methodists, to whom the regular pulpits
were closed, and who went forth to preach in the fields—who
separated from the Church more in form than in reality—produced
a moral revolution in England which probably saved us
from the fate of nations wholly abandoned to their own devices.”—<i>From

<p class='c016'>From the “Memoirs of Howard, compiled from his diary, his
confidential letters, and other authentic documents, by James
Baldwin Brown,” it appears that in the year 1755, on a voyage to
Portugal, the vessel in which he was, was captured by a French
privateer, and carried into Brest, where he and the other passengers,
along with the crew, were cast into a filthy dungeon, and
there kept a considerable time without nourishment. There they
lay for six days and nights. The floor, with nothing but straw
upon it, was their sleeping place. He was afterwards removed to
Morlaix, and thence to Carpaix, where he was two months upon
parole. At the latter place “he corresponded with the English
prisoners at Brest, Morlaix and Dinnan; and had sufficient evidence
of their being treated with such barbarity that many hundreds
had perished; and that thirty-six were buried in a hole at
Dinnan in one day.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Through his benevolent and timely interference on their behalf,
when he himself had regained his freedom, the prisoners of war
in these three prisons were released and sent home to England
in the first cartel ships.</p>

<p class='c007'>Till the year 1773 it does not appear that he was actively engaged
in any philanthropic work on behalf of prisoners. In the
year 1730 there had been a commission of enquiry in the House
of Commons on the state of prisons, and condition of their inmates,
but nothing seems to have followed from it, and it was
not till March, 1774, when Howard received the thanks of the
House for the information which, he communicated to them on
the subject, that the great work assumed shape. In 1773, having
been appointed sheriff of Bedford, the distress of prisoners came
under his notice. He engaged himself in a most minute inspection,
and the consequence was the devotion of every faculty of
his existence to the correction of the abuses existing in similar
institutions as the friend of those who had no friend.</p>

<p class='c007'>In that Christlike work he continued till his death, on 20th January,
1790, at Cherson, Russian Tartary, having in the meantime
inspected prisons in England, Scotland and Ireland, France,
Holland, Flanders, Germany, Switzerland, Italy, Sweden, Poland,
Portugal, Spain, the Netherlands, Malta, Turkey, Prussia
and Russia.</p>

<p class='c016'>At Michaelmas time, 1791, Mr. Buchanan was admitted a member
of Queen’s College, Cambridge, having left London on the
24th October. He was then 25 years of age. In consequence of
a letter from his mother he attended the preaching of John Newton,
with whom he kept up a correspondence when at college.
In one of his replies to Mr. Newton he wrote: “You ask me
whether I would prefer preaching the Gospel to the fame of
learning? Ay, that would I, gladly, were I convinced it was the
will of God, that I should depart this night for Nova Zembla, or
the Antipodes, to testify of Him. I would not wait for an admit
or a college exit.” Some time in the year 1794, the first proposal
appears to have been made to him to go out to India, and on this
occasion he wrote Mr. Newton, saying, “I have only time to say,
that with respect to my going to India, I must decline giving an
opinion. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* It is with great pleasure I submit this matter
to the determination of yourself and Mr. Thornton and Mr.
Grant. All I wish to ascertain is the will of God.” In a subsequent
letter he wrote, “I am equally ready to preach the Gospel
in the next village, or at the end of the earth.”</p>

<p class='c007'>After taking his degree of B.A., he was ordained a deacon by
the Bishop of London on 20th September, 1795, when he became
Mr. Newton’s curate, which he held till March, 1796, when
he was appointed one of the chaplains to the East India Company.
Soon after, he received priest’s orders, and on 11th
August, 1796, sailed from Portsmouth, England, for Calcutta,
where he landed 10th March, 1797. In May following he
proceeded to the military station of Barackpore. But it was not
till the beginning of the present century that he fairly developed
his plans for the extension of the Redeemer’s Kingdom in
India.—<i>From Memoirs of Rev. Claudius Buchanan.</i></p>

<p class='c016'>In the month of September, 1794, a paper was published in the
<i>Evangelical Magazine</i>, urging the formation of a mission to the
heathen on the broadest possible basis. The writer of that paper
<span class='pageno' id='Page_320'>320</span>was the Rev. David Bogue, D.D., of Gosport, Hampshire, and
two months after its appearance a conference, attended by representatives
from several Evangelical bodies, was held to take
action in the matter. The result was an address to ministers
and members of various churches, and the appointment of a
committee to diffuse information upon the subject. Thereafter,
and in September, 1795, a large and influential meeting, extending
over three days, at which the Rev. Dr. Harris preached from
Mark xv: 16, and the Rev. J. Burder and the Rev. Rowland Hill
and many others took part. At that meeting the society was
formed, and it was resolved, with reference to its agents and
their converts, “That it should be entirely left with those whom
God might call into the fellowship of His Son among them, to
assume for themselves such a form of church government as to
them shall appear most agreeable to the Word of God.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The Rev. David Bogue, D.D., has therefore well been styled
“the father and founder” of the institution.</p>

<p class='c016'>At a meeting held in Leeds, 5th October, 1813, it was resolved
to constitute a society to be called “The Methodist Missionary
Society for the Leeds District,” of which branches were to be
formed in the several circuits, whose duty it should be to collect
subscriptions in behalf of missions and to remit them to an
already existing committee in London. It was from this point
that, by general consent, the origin of the Wesleyan Missionary
Society is reckoned.</p>

Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without

Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,

to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official

  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
